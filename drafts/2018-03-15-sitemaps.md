## What is a sitemap?
A [sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps) is an XML file containing a list of the URLs on a website. Sitemaps are created by webmasters to tell search engines what URLs on a website should be searchable. Sitemaps may also provide additional metadata about each URL, such as the last modified date.

Example: [https://search.gov/sitemap.xml](https://search.gov/sitemap.xml)  

## Why should I use a sitemap?
A sitemap provides information that allows a search engine to index your website more intelligently, and to keep its search index up to date.

## Does search.gov use sitemaps?
Yes! Search.gov uses sitemaps to tell us what URLs should be in our index and when a URL has been updated. Sitemaps are also used by [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184), Yahoo, Bing, and and other search engines.

## What should my sitemap look like?
Please refer to the official [sitemaps protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) for information on how a sitemap should be structured.

## What metadata does Search.gov require for each sitemap URL?
The sitemap protocol defines [required and optional XML tags](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions) for each URL. Search.gov recommends including the `<lastmod>` value (the date of last modification of the file) whenever possible, to indicate when a file has been updated and needs to be re-indexed. (We do not have plans to support the `<priority>` tag, which is [no longer used](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-priority-change-frequency-xml-sitemap-20273.html) by search engines like Google. We may support the `<changefreq>` tag in the future, but the `<lastmod>` tag is more accurate and supported by more search engines.)

## How can I create a sitemap?
Most content management systems provide tools to generate a sitemap and keep it updated. Below are some tools that we recommend:

### Drupal
[XML Sitemap Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap)

### Wordpress
[Yoast SEO Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)
[Google Sitemap Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/)

### Wagtail
[Sitemap Generator](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/reference/contrib/sitemaps.html)

### Github Pages (Jekyll)
[Jekyll Sitemap gem](https://help.github.com/articles/sitemaps-for-github-pages/)

### Online generators
(Note: free online generators often have a limit to the number of URLs they will include, and do not always generate the most accurate sitemaps. Use them only as a last resort.)

[Free Sitemap Generator](https://freesitemapgenerator.com)    
[Web Sitemap](http://www.web-site-map.com/)    

## How do search engines find my sitemap(s)?
Sitemap URLs (or the sitemap index url) should be listed in your site’s robots.txt file, i.e.:  
`Sitemap: https://www.agency.gov/sitemap_1.xml`  
`Sitemap: https://www.agency.gov/sitemap_2.xml`  

Example: https://search.gov/robots.txt

## Sitemap checklist
* One or more sitemaps have been created
* The URLs in the sitemap have been reviewed (clean URLs, no URLs that should _not_ be indexed)
* Each sitemap’s XML format has been [validated](http://tools.seochat.com/tools/site-validator/)
* Each sitemap (or a sitemap index) listed in the site’s robots.txt file

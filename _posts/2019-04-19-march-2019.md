## Improvements
* We’ve continued to work on improving our recently launched click-based relevancy to boost search results relevance ranking for our indexing customers. As always, it’s important to periodically review your site’s Best Bets and keep your sitemaps up-to-date with latest `<lastmod>` date metadata.
* We continued to upgrade components of our service, including ElasticSearch, Rails, and Ruby to improve the overall performance of our indexing system.
* We launched a new Search Site Launch Guide to make it easier to go live with Search.gov:
  * https://search.gov/manual/site-launch-guide.html
* Released new documentation to make it easier to maintain your indexed content with Search.gov: 
  * https://search.gov/manual/indexing-with-searchgov.html

## Fixes and Chores	
* We mitigated potential security vulnerabilities associated with Ruby gems.
* We applied high priority Ubuntu patches.

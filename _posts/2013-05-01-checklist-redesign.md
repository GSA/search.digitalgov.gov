We often receive questions when an affiliate undergoes a major website upgrade, changes content management systems, or both. We created this checklist to share with you four steps to take to ensure your redesign is successful.

1. Keep the file name and directly structure the same, if possible. If it isn't possible, use 301 redirects to send visitors to the appropriate new pages. For more on 301 redirects, read tips from [Bing](http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/webmaster/archive/2011/10/06/managing-redirects-301s-302s-and-canonicals.aspx)&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"></i> and [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633)&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"></i>. Notify other websites that link to you of the changes.
2. Register for the commercial search engines' webmaster tools.  
    * [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster)&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"></i>   
    * [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en)&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"></i>
3. Update the [XML sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org)&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"></i> on your website and notify the search engines via the webmaster tools.
4. Notify the search engines of the content that has been removed via the webmaster tools. Specifically, in Bing, use the [Site Move tool](http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/webmaster/archive/2013/03/15/bing-wmt-launches-site-move-tool.aspx)&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"></i>.

If you've undergone a redesign, followed these four steps, and you still don't see your content updated in your site search results, please notify us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov>.

After you've [logged in](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) and [added a site](/manual/add-site.html) with your official government email, you can add your coworkers to your site.

You can add anyone you'd like to your site&mdash;with or without a .gov or .mil email address. Email addresses outside the .gov or .mil domains must be associated with a business. Personal emails, such as @gmail.com or @yahoo.com, are not allowed.

We use [color coding](/manual/color-codes.html) to indicate each user's status. 

| Color | Status | 
| :------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| No color&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Approved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| Yellow  | Pending email verification: user must verify their email address via the introductory email they received from our system |
| Yellow  | Pending approval: requires manual approval by the Search.gov team |
| Red   | Not approved: to regain access, the user must be manually re-approved by the Search.gov team |

***Did you know?*** We recommend adding a generic email account (such as webteam@agency.gov) as a user to ensure ongoing access to your account as individuals come and go.

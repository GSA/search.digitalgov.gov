## Tell Us About Your Flickr Photostream

Provide us with the *full URL* for your Flickr photostream. Most photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa>{% external_link %} for HUD). Some photostreams are in the groups folder (e.g., <http://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov>{% external_link %} for USA.gov).

The URL must be for your overall photostream. You cannot specify individual photos, sets, favorites, or maps.

## Opt to Display Your Flickr Images

When you add the URL for your Flickr photostream, we'll automatically index all of the images in your photostream.

On the image results page, we'll automatically backfill the standard image results from your website with the images from your Flickr photostream.

Turn on the Photos GovBox on the [Display Overview](/sites/manual/display-overview.html) page to display up to five relevant Flickr images as inline results on your web search results page.

See the sample results page below that shows photo results displayed on the National Ocean Service for a search on *[humpback whales](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=humpback+whales&affiliate=oceanservice.noaa.gov)*.

***Did you know?*** Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery? You can index [MRSS feeds](/sites/manual/rss.html) so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.

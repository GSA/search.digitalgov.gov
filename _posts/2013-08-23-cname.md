We offer DNS masking, which allows you to show searchers search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). Follow these three steps to mask your domain.

1. E-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov> and ask us to mask your domain.
2. Create a CNAME in your DNS records for *search.yoursite.gov*. Point it to *search.usa.gov.edgekey.net*.
3. When the setup is complete, change the code for your form action from *search.usa.gov* to *search.yoursite.gov*.

***Did you know?*** By default, we set up search.YOURSITE.gov (such as search.nih.gov). If this subdomain is already used by another application, you can request YOURSITEsearch.YOURSITE.gov (such as usdasearch.usda.gov) or another pattern.

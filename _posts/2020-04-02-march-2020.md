## Improvements

* **Search.gov Account Signup:** First Name and Last Name are now their own fields on user profiles. Where possible, these fields are pre-filled, but in some cases, users will need to complete the Last Name field on their next login before proceeding.
* **Elasticsearch Query Updates:** We updated our search query logic to increase response times for some websites.
* **Improved Security:** We found and resolved some security vulnerabilities.

## Fixes

* **Account Deactivation Reminders:** Previously, some users were receiving account deactivation warnings in error. This has now been resolved, and the email copy has been updated.

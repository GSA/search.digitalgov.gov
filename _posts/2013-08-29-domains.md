Enter the applicable domains, subdomains, or folders to return results specific to your website. You do not need to include http:// as we recognize domains with or without it. 

## Entire Site

List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.

## Part of Site

* List www.yoursite.gov to include only the primary 'www' domain. 
* List subdomain.yoursite.gov to include subdomains. 
* List yoursite.gov/folder to include folders. 

You cannot specify individual URLs.

***Troubleshooting Tip:*** You can *exclude* specific subdomains or folders using any of the following options. 

1. List the excluded subdomains or folders in your [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) file. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.
2. Exclude them by omission. For example, to exclude subdomain3, list only subdomain1.yoursite.gov, subdomain2.yoursite.gov, and subdomain4.yoursite.gov.
3. E-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov> to filter them from your site's search results. Note that this option should be used only if the other options aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.

<a id="filter"></a>***Troubleshooting Tip:*** You can remove or filter specific URLs using any of the following options.

1. Remove the page from your site and return a 404 (Not Found) 401 (Gone), or 301 (Permanently Moved) HTTP status. 
2. Add a [noindex robots metatag or x-robots tag](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_meta_tag?csw=1) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif). This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.
3. Request the page's removal using the [Block URLs option in Bing Webaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/block-urls-from-bing-264e560a) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) and [Remove URLs option in Google Webmaster Tools](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1663419) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif).
4. Use the Filter URLs option under the [Advanced](/sites/manual/display-advanced.html) tab. 

***Troubleshooting Tip:*** Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? You can tell us about any missing URLs via an RSS feed or manually (the Supplemental Feed and Supplemental URLs options under the [Advanced](/sites/manual/display-advanced.html) tab, respectively). We'll fetch and index the pages and append them to your web results.

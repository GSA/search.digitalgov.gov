<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p><em>Helping searchers find forms</em></p>
<p>Similar to our existing <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=census+bureau&amp;affiliate=usagov">agency</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=diabetes">health</a> GovBoxes, we created a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=i9+form">forms</a> GovBox to help searchers find federal government forms. So far, we've included forms from the Department of Defense, General Services Administration, Social Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>We've also published the forms data as a <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/forms.shtml">Federal Forms API</a> for third-party developers.</p>
<p><strong>Chores</strong></p>
<ul><li>We upgraded our robots.txt parser to account for comments and varying cases.</li>
<li>We eliminated support for six <a href="/blog/legacy-domains.html">legacy domains</a> as part of the .gov web reform project.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul><li>We fixed broken URLs for Best Bets image files.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug with our browser user agent so that Internet Explorer users no longer sometimes see a blank results page.</li>
<li>We fixed a CSS validation bug so you don't see an error message when editing your header or footer.</li>
<li>We updated a broken link for Explore Topics on m.USA.gov.</li>
</ul>

## Improvements
* We launched updated Freshness ranking for customers indexed by Search.gov. The fresher a page the more likely it is to be promoted. Previously, we only factored the date a page is created into its freshness. Now, we first factor the date a page was last modified and then, the date a page is created. This new feature highlights the importance of ensuring that metadata on your site's pages and sitemap is accurate. Here is more information about how we rank your search results: https://search.gov/manual/ranking-factors.html
* We continued to upgrade components of our service, including ElasticSearch, Rails, and Ruby to improve the overall performance of our indexing system.

## Fixes and Chores	
* Fixed a bug that made it difficult to view sidebar items on the search results page when hovering over individual links. Now, the experience when hovering over these links is fully accessible.

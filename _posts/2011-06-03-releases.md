<p>In the ongoing government effort for transparency, we are going to use our blog to post our release notes on a monthly basis. While they may not be the most exciting posts ever, it seems the logical place to publish our activities. Search, as many know, is difficult with many of the improvements happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>We divide our work into three categories:</p>
<p>1) Features &#8212; things that you actually notice</p>
<p>2) Bugs &#8212; Fixes to any code issues that may arise </p>
<p>3) Chores &#8212; back-end improvements that you don't notice </p>
<p>We did complete a big chore this month by upgrading to Rails 3 which will be invisible to you, but it will bring additional stability for our search environment and allow us to have longer feature list in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>New/Enhanced Features:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Searchers see new second-level top navigation on landing pages and SERPs on <a href="http://Search.USA.gov">Search.USA.gov</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/?locale=es">Buscador.USA.gov</a></li>
<li>Spanish searchers see improved <a href="http://search.usa.gov/?locale=es">web</a> and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/images?locale=es&amp;m=false">image</a> landing pages</li>

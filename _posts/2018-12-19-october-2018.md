## Improvements
* We made several updates to our Chef cookbooks to further harden our operating system, including backend password policies, package configuration, and OS configuration.
* We shifted our model for supporting domain masks for hosted search results pages to leverage CAA records.

## Fixes
* We fixed a gnarly bug in Elasticsearch that made queries containing very common words, like "the", behave as if there were no results.

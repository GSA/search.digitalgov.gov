<p>Good news! We completed a major upgrade of our search infrastructure. You likely didn't notice as we completed the upgrade without any downtime for searchers on your site. </p>
<p>Our system is now even more secure, stable, and redundant than it was before. Plus, it is faster, too. Highlights of the upgrade follow.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multihoming</strong></em></p>
<p>We've always had a disaster recovery, backup datacenter, but it often sat idle. We wanted to make better use of all of our servers so we're now leveraging a content delivery network to send traffic to whichever datacenter is geographically closest to the searcher. This allows us to use both datacenters equally and serve our results quickly.</p>

<p><em><strong>New Hardware</strong></em></p>
<p>We increased our RAM and CPU resources by five times. We have room to grow and to roll out more features.</p>
<p><em><strong>Upgraded Software</strong></em></p>
<p>We're now on Red Hat 6 and Cloudera 4.</p>
<p><em><strong>Speed, Speed, Speed</strong></em></p>
<p>We're always working to improve the speed of our search results. We changed some of our caching rules. We also started to leverage <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> (a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server).</p>

> **Important Note:** April, 2018. For new implementations, the Search.gov team recommends you index your content with us not using our Drupal module to send content to our i14y indexing API, but rather by publishing a comprehensive XML sitemap, which we can use to index your content. We recommend the [XML Sitemap module](https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap){% external_link %}. [Read more.](/blog/six-months-in.html)

To use the Search.gov service on a Drupal-based website, you should install the [XML Sitemap](https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap){% external_link %} module, and may want to consider a tool like [Yoast SEO](https://www.drupal.org/project/yoast_seo){% external_link %} to pull in non-Drupal content as well. You may also be interested in our overview of [XML sitemaps](/blog/sitemaps.html).

The `usasearch` [Drupal module](https://drupal.org/project/usasearch){% external_link %} can facilitate indexing content with our service, but we prefer the XML sitemap method. 

* It is possible to manually modify the Drupal search box to connect to our service, but the module allows you to make the connection via a setting configuration, rather than code work.

## Step by step instructions for setting up the module

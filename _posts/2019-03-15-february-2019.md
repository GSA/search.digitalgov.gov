## Improvements

* We've added Click counts as a ranking factor for customers indexed by Search.gov. We look at the URLs that represent 75% of all clicks on search results, and give those a boost. This is the "fat head" that comes before the "long tail." As always, following best practices will help results stay relevant:
  * Use Best Bets to promote frequently visited pages that are not bubbling to the top of results on their own
  * Periodically review and update Best Bets
  * Maintain an up-to-date and complete sitemap with updated <lastmod> dates

## Fixes, Upgrades, Misc

* Fixed an issue with the type-ahead feature on customer search boxes
* Fixed an issue with disappearing search icon on search boxes
* Continued with Rails upgrade for our applications

## Improvements

* **Account Deactivation Reminders:** Search.gov users who have been inactive for more than 90 days must be deactivated, per security requirements. We will now send email reminders to log in prior to the 90 day mark to keep their accounts active.
* **Search.gov Account Signup:** Users will need to complete all account information in order to manage their websites. On the back end, we have added new fields for first name and last name, which users will soon be seeing in their accounts. Where possible, these fields will be pre-filled, but in some cases, users will need to complete the Last Name field on their next login before proceeding.

## Tell Us About Your YouTube Channel

Provide us with the *full URL* for your YouTube channel. 

Some channels use a visitor-friendly name and are in the user folder (such as <https://www.youtube.com/user/NASAtelevision> for NASA). 

Others use an alphanumeric string and are in the channel folder (such as <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw> for NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). 

Either URL format works.

## Opt to Display Your Videos

When you add the URL for your YouTube channel, we'll automatically index your videos&mdash;both your uploaded videos and playlists.

We'll show the videos by default. You can toggle the settings for showing your videos on the [Display Overview](/manual/display-overview.html) page, choosing to show them as a facet, inline module, or both.

**Facet**

![Videos Facet on DigitalGov.gov](https://search.digitalgov.gov/img/Videos-Facet.png "Videos Facet on DigitalGov.gov"){:height="95%" width="95%"}

**Inline Module**

![Inline Module on DigitalGov.gov](https://search.digitalgov.gov/img/Videos-Inline-Module.png "Inline Module on DigitalGov.gov"){:height="95%" width="95%"}

You can edit the default facet label, Videos, on the [RSS](/manual/rss.html) page.

***Did you know?*** Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery? You can index [MRSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.

## Highlights
* We began work on using click data in our relevancy ranking, starting with 
  * Recording the domain of the clicked-on URL separately, so we can manage all the clicks for a particular domain.
  * Calculating the top N clicked-on URLs for a given domain.

## Chores
* We indexed a lot of content for agencies.
* We got our new developers set up and ready to work on great stuff.

## Bug Fixes
* None

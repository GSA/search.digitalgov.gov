## Features

* Searchers now see the most current titles and descriptions available for [YouTube videos](/sites/manual/youtube.html) and they won't see any deleted videos.
* Visitors to the pages search.usa.gov and buscador.usa.gov are now automatically redirected to [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) and [GobiernoUSA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa), respectively, so they see the most recent content on these homepages.
* Spanish searchers now see [plain language](http://www.plainlanguage.gov) helper text.
* Searchers no longer see two search boxes on the search results page, which will create a more visually appealing and usable page.

## Chores

* We rewrote some query routing rules for job searches to present more precise results in the [Jobs GovBox](/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html).
* We configured [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) to enable continuous integration for the [Recalls Server API](https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api) and [Jobs Server API](https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api).
* We shortened the Jobs API base URL to <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search>.
* We reconfigured our RSS feed fetching to update more efficiently.
* We upgraded to [Rails 3.2.12](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/11/SEC-ANN-Rails-3-2-12-3-1-11-and-2-3-17-have-been-released) and [Rack](http://rubygems.org/gems/rack) 1.4.5.
* We upgraded our [Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products/cdh.html) (CDH) cluster.
* We removed the outdated yellow call out boxes from the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/).

## Fixes

* You'll no longer see an error message if you delete a site that has a YouTube profile or when adding a site that has no managed RSS feed.

## Improvements
* **Sitelimit parameter support**
  * Now our customers can specify that a search box only returns results from a particular part of their site. For example, for site www.example.gov,  you want a search box on your site to only return results from `www.example.gov/history`. By adding the appropriate URL parameter and value, you can limit results: `&sitelimit=www.example.gov/history`. 
  * You can also specify multiple values for the sitelimit. See this [example from the National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/search/?affiliate=nps&query=seneca&sitelimit=www.nps.gov/subjects/oceans+www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory). 
  * Keep in mind that the sitelimit must be for a domain within your site's index. That is, if the Domains list includes `www.example.gov`, the sitelimit parameter cannot be `www.agency.gov/history`.
  * This feature is an alternative to our Collections feature.
* **Service upgrades**
  * We continued to upgrade components of our service, including ElasticSearch, Rails, and Ruby to improve the overall performance of our indexing system.

## Fixes	
* **Highlighting bug**
  * We fixed a bug that prevented highlighting for exact, phrased queries on sites indexed by Search.gov. [Here's an example of it working correctly now](https://search.usa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=usasearch&sort_by=&query=%22search+features%22).

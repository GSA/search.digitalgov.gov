<h2>Highlighted Feature</h2>
<p>This week we buckled down and analyzed data on jobs-related searches to ensure that the new federal <a href="/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a> lists the <span>most relevant </span><span>job openings. </span></p>
<p>Searchers can now effectively search for jobs by keyword, agency, state, or work schedule (part-or full-time).</p>
<p>We also focused on not showing the Jobs GovBox when it isn't relevant (for example, it is no longer shown when searchers look for job safety posters or employment verification forms).</p>
<h2>Chores</h2>
<ul><li><span>We added our posting channel ID to all USAJobs links.</span></li>
<li><span>We set up a cron job to fetch and process job files from USAJobs.</span></li>
<li><span>We added impression and click tracking for the Jobs GovBox module.</span></li>
<li><span>We resolved performance discrepancy between our <a href="/releases/2012-10-19.html">two datacenters</a>.</span></li>
<li><span>We no longer use XML sitemaps to add documents to our web index.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul><li><span>You can now delete keywords from text best bets.</span></li>
<li><span>Newly added misspellings are now being applied to type-ahead suggestions.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Searchers can now find jobs in non-standard state locations (for example someone searching for jobs in Washington, DC, will find postings the the location of Washington DC Metro Area, District of Columbia)</span><span>.</span></span></li>
</ul>

Find it in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Preview

As you update your site's display settings, you can preview your search results page before pushing the changes to your live website.

Visit our [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/), select your site, and click on the Preview option (the eye icon) in the left-hand menu.

***Did you know?*** You can also preview (and share) your search results page by typing https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=**YourSiteHandle** into the address bar in any browser. (Your site handle is listed on the [Settings](https://search.gov/manual/settings.html) page in the Admin Center, if you don't know it.)

***Did you know?*** If you're still on our legacy results page, you'll see two to three options.

**View Staged.** This option allows you to view the staged search results page before you publish it to your live site. You'll see this option if you have staged changes.

**View Current.** This option allows you to view the current, live search results page on your site. This is the only option you'll see if you don't have any staged changes.

**View Redesigned Page.** This option allows you to view the [newly redesigned search results page](https://search.gov/blog/serp-redesign.html) as it'll appear on your site after May 30, 2014.

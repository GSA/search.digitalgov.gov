You can use USASearch to power the search box on your federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government website at no cost.

Access to our hosted search service requires authentication and verification that you're a government employee or contractor.

## Log In

[Log in](https://search.usa.gov/sites) to an existing account or register for a new account at <http://usasearch.howto.gov>. Select the Login option in the upper right-hand corner and fill out your information.

![Login from USASearch.HowTo.gov](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/login.png)

After you register, you'll receive an automatic e-mail. Click on the link in the e-mail to verify that your e-mail address belongs to you.

If you have a .gov or .mil address, you'll be able to access your account immediately after you verify your e-mail.

If you don't have a .gov or .mil address, we'll ask for additional information to confirm that you're a government employee or contractor. We'll notify you when your account is approved.

## Add a Site

Once your account is approved, you can [add a site](/sites/manual/add-site.html) in our [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites).

## Update Your Contact Information

You can edit your name, agency, or email by selecting the option, My Account, in the drop-down menu in the upper-right hand corner.

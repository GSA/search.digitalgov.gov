The Queries page reports on the number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box on your site by a unique searcher.

Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.

Data start from the time your agency started using USASearch (but no further back than 2009).

## Top Queries

***Top 1,000.*** You'll see a list, in frequency order, of top 1,000 most popular queries for your selected time period. 

***Top 1,000 by query.*** Enter any specific term or phrase into the Query search box. Re-generate the report to see the top 1,000 queries that contain that term or phrase and its stemmed equivalents. 

For example, below are the top 10 queries related to *housing* on USA.gov in August 2013.

1. house of representatives
2. housing
3. speaker of the house
4. white house
5. house minority leader
6. housing assistance
7. house majority leader
8. speaker of the house 2013
9. the white house

## Highlighted Feature

The display of search results pages is constantly evolving. Some changes are subtle. Others are more noticeable.

In line with industry best practices and commercial search engines, we've moved the tools for filtering and sorting results to the top of results list (rather than on the left side). We've also added an option to clear all filters.

## Chores
* We upgraded to [Rails 3.2.11]("http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released).

## Fixes
* Searchers no longer see Did You Mean suggestions for your excluded domains.
* We fixed a cross browser compatibility issue on the Query Logs page in the Admin Center so that the number of clicks' column is now visible.
* We labeled the Safe Search radio options on our [advanced search page](http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=govbenefits) as a fieldset to improve accessibility for screen readers.

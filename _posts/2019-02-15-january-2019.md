## Improvements

* After integrating directly with the new USAJOBS API, we worked on additional tuning of trigger words to avoid false positive job-related searches
* We have improved search performance by caching repeat queries made to our data store
* We updated our content parser to accept some non-standard HTML tags, and to ignore any content within `<nav>` and `<footer>` elements

## Fixes, Upgrades, Misc

* We upgraded Ruby on our `search-gov` repo
* We increased the processing power on the servers that support our primary web index
* We reindexed our primary index into more Elasticsearch shards
* We decreased the cookie timeout for Admin Center sessions
* We made the failed password reset alert language more ambiguous, so people will no longer be able to tell whether the email address has an account
* We fixed a bug in our MRSS photo indexer

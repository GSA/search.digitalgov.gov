## Overview

When you're buying and using products, safety comes first.

Six federal regulatory agencies issue recalls on [Recalls.gov](http://www.recalls.gov).

This Recalls API allows you to tap into a list of (1) drug and food safety recalls from the [Food and Drug Administration](http://www.fda.gov) (FDA), [U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service](http://www.fsis.usda.gov) (UDSA FSIS), and [FoodSafety.gov](http://www.FoodSafety.gov); (2) car safety recalls from the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](http://www.nhtsa.gov) (NHTSA); and (3) product safety recalls from the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](http://www.cpsc.gov) (CPSC).

This API is great for consumer safety websites or applications, news organizations, and websites or magazines targeted to specific audiences, such as parents.

<a name="using-the-api"></a>

## Using the API

This Recalls API accepts a GET request.

Recalls are searchable by keyword, issuing agency, date, UPC code, vehicle-specific attributes, or any combination of these.

The base URL is http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?**parameters**

Sample API requests follow.

All recalls  
<http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?>

All cribs  
<http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs>

All cribs that pose a choking hazard  
<http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking>


All cribs that pose a choking hazard sorted by date  
<http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?query=cribs+choking&sort=date>

<a name="parameters"></a>

## Parameters

Seven generic parameters are accepted.

1. query
1. organization
1. start_date
1. end_date
1. page
1. per_page
1. sort

There are additional parameters that are specific to food, product, and car safety recalls. None are required.

### query

Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "choke" will find a recall categorized as a "choking" hazard.

### organization

Specifies which agency issued the recall. Possible values are `CPSC`, `FDA`, `NHTSA`, or `USDA`.

Example (one agency): <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=nhtsa>

Example (multiple agencies): <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?organization=fda+usda>

### start_date

Specifies the start date of the recall.

Example: <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?start_date=2012-01-01>

### end_date

Specifies the end date of the recall.

Example: <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?end_date=2012-12-31>

### page

Specifies the pagination of search results. Possible values are `1` to `20`.

Example: <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?page=3>

### per_page

Specifies the number of search results for each page. Possible values are `1` to `50`.

Example: <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?per_page=10>

### sort

Results are sorted by relevance by default. Possible values are `rel` or `date`. Use 'sort=date' to sort results by date with the most recent listed first.

Example: <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?sort=date>

### food_type 
Only for drug and food safety recalls. Possible values are `food` or `drug`.

Example: <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?food_type=drug>

### upc

Only for CPSC recalls. Specifies the UPC code when available. Not all products have UPC codes.

Example: <http://api.usa.gov/recalls/search.json?upc=042666601627>

### make, model, year, and code (only for NHTSA recalls)

* `make` specifies the make of the vehicle or equipment. Example: <http://localhost:3000/search?make=winnebago>
* `model` specifies the model of the vehicle or equipment. Example: <http://localhost:3000/search?model=ellipse>
* `year` specifies the year of the vehicle or equipment. Example: <http://localhost:3000/search?year=2010>
* `code` specifies the NHTSA code. Possible values are `E`, `V` [for vehicles], `I`, `T`, `C`, or `X`. Example: <http://localhost:3000/search?code=v>

## Data Sources

We've tailored this Recalls API for our use in the [USA.gov iPhone app](http://apps.usa.gov/usagov.shtml). 

Data are normalized across (1) drug and food safety recalls from the [FDA](http://www.fda.gov), [UDSA FSIS](http://www.fsis.usda.gov), and [FoodSafety.gov](http://www.FoodSafety.gov); (2) car safety recalls from the [NHTSA](http://www.nhtsa.gov); and (3) product safety recalls from the [CPSC](http://www.cpsc.gov).

So, we encourage you to use the five original data sources directly or via [Recalls.gov](http://www.recalls.gov).

1. [FDA recalls, market withdrawals, and safety alerts](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/default.htm)
2. [USDA FSIS recalls and public health alerts](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts)
3. [FoodSafety.gov recalls and alerts](http://www.foodsafety.gov/recalls)
4. [NHTSA recalls and defects](http://www.nhtsa.gov/Vehicle+Safety/Recalls+&+Defects)
5. [CPSC recalls](http://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/)

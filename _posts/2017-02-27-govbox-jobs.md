One of the most common search tasks is to look for current job openings. We created the Jobs module to help searchers quickly find relevant jobs. 

When you [turn on the Job Openings](/manual/display-overview.html) module, searchers looking for jobs on your site will see up to three relevant jobs listings on your results page. You will need to [contact us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) to get the Jobs module enabled for your site.

## Federal Government

* **Federal Cross-Agency Portals.** If your website is a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the Job Openings module will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across all federal agencies*. 
* **Federal Department Websites.** If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the Job Openings module will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across all agencies within your department*. 
* **Federal Agency or Office Websites.** If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the Job Openings module will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings *at your agency*. 

Searchers will also see a direct link to [USAJobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov) for all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable), as shown in the sample below for a search on [*jobs*](http://search.doi.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=doi.gov&query=jobs") on DOI.gov.

 **Did you know?** Are you a federal agency that doesn't post your jobs on USAJobs? We want your jobs data. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> to let us know where you publish your job openings so that we can include them in the Job Openings module.

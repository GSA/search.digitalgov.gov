After you've [signed in and added a site](/sites/manual/add-site.html) with your official government email, you can add your coworkers to your site.

You can add anyone you'd like to your site&mdash;with or without a .gov or .mil email address.

***Did you know?*** We recommend adding a generic email account (such as webteam@agency.gov) as a user to ensure ongoing access to your USASearch account as individuals come and go.

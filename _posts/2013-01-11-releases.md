## Highlighted Feature: The Jobs GovBox

We're excited to announce that searchers looking for jobs on your site can now see all of your agency's current job openings.

Our new [Job Openings Govbox](/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html) displays up to three location- and keyword-matched job openings on your results page. For more information on how to turn on this GovBox, see [How To Select The Modules That Appear On Your Results Page](/sites/manual/display-overview.html).

We've also open sourced all of the code that powers our [Jobs Server API](https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api) in Github.

## Fixes

And, we've already pushed two bug fixes for the Jobs GovBox to production. Searchers no longer see yet-to-be-opened or already closed jobs.

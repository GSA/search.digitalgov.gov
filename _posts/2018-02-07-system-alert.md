There may be times when you want to add a system alert to your search results page. For instance, during a [site redesign](/blog/redesign.html), you may wish to inform searchers that your site is in transition. 

Use the Search Page Alert feature to add a text message to your search results page, which will appear at all times above all search results, *regardless of the query*. Enter a title and text for the alert, set the status to active, and hit `Save` to turn on your alert. The appearance of the alert is not customizable.

See, for example, the custom alert on Defense.gov announcing their migration to a new system.

***Did you know?*** See also our closely related feature [Best Bets](/manual/best-bets.html), which allows you to recommend individual results or sets of results, which will appear *only when a searcher's query matches* the text of their titles, descriptions, or keywords.

## Highlighted Feature: Limiting Results to a Subset of Your Content

Do you want to set up a search box (or even hundreds of search boxes) over a subset of your content? 

You can set up a [Collection](http://usasearch.howto.gov/blog/how-to-create-collections-within-our-index.html). Or, you can now pass in a 'sitelimit' parameter to filter the results to specific folders or domains.

### Option 1. Set Up a Collection

See the sample results page on <NIH.gov> that shows results for a search on [*cancer*]((http://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&dc=565&query=cancer) in NIH.gov's New Releases.

Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to News in the left-hand menu.

### Option 2. Use the Sitelimit Parameter

Compare the collection-based results above with the results for [the same search using the sitelimit parameter](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nih&query=cancer&sitelimit=nih.gov/news).

Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to nih.gov/news in a message under the search box, among other differences.

## Other Feature

* Searchers' see job openings in their state *before* the listings for jobs in other states.

## Chores

* We added sequester/sequestration as an entry in our synonym file so that searchers looking for information on the topic find all relevant results.
* We throttled the YouTube RSSFeedFetcher to avoid HTTP 403 errors.
* We added some compound indexes to speed up queries.
* We added JSONP support for the [Jobs API](http://usasearch.howto.gov/developer/jobs.html) and [Recalls API](http://usasearch.howto.gov/developer/recalls.html).
* We investigated additional sources for jobs openings, such as the Department of Labor's [Summer Jobs](http://developer.dol.gov/DOL-SUMMERJOBS-SERVICE.htm) and the National Resource Directory's [Veterans Jobs Bank](https://www.nrd.gov/home/api/veterans_job_search). 
* We moved the publishing platform for [USASearch.HowTo.gov](http://usasearch.howto.gov) from Tumblr to [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Fixes

* Visitors to eForms.gov, FedForms.gov, and Forms.gov are now automatically redirected to the USA.gov's list of [government forms by agency](http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Reference-Shelf/forms.shtml).
* We tuned the redirect on search.usa.gov/images so that all needed images show up on results pages.

## Homepage URL

Tell us the homepage URL of your website. Enter a fully qualified URL, including http://, http://www, etc. 

**Correct Syntax**

* http://www.whitehouse.gov  
* http://louisiana.gov    
* http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/  
* http://nimh.nih.gov/  
* http://www.ci.bloomington.mn.us/   

**Incorrect Syntax**

* usa.gov (use http://www.usa.gov)  
* www.nasa.gov (use http://www.nasa.gov)  
* http://www.ftc.gov/opa/index.shtml (use the higher-level folder, http://www.ftc.gov/opa)  
* http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000?utm_source=OCM&utm_medium=print-radio&utm_term=&utm_campaign=shortcuts (use the higher-level domain, http://www.gsa.gov)
* http://www.doc.gov (use the domain that resolves, http://www.commerce.gov)  

We use this homepage URL to (a) populate your primary [domain](/sites/manual/domains.html) and (b) link the default logo on your results page to your homepage.

## Display Name

Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your site name on the results page, such as in your page title or best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, such as National Institutes of Health.

## Site Handle

We use your site handle in the HTTP request to specify displaying your customized settings. We recommend making this handle short and unique, such as nih.

Handles can have lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores only. They can't have spaces and other punctuation.

![Site name and handle on NIH.gov's search results page](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/settings.png)

## Site Language (Required)

Choose a language for your site, English or Spanish. We will only index and provide results for pages in your selected language. All display text on the results page will also be in your selected language.

***Troubleshooting Tip:*** Once you've added your site, edit your display name on the [Settings](/sites/manual/settings.html) page. If you later need to edit your site handle or language, e-mail us at <USASearch@gsa.gov>.

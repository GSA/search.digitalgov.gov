Last year the Department of Labor (DOL) participated in the [First Fridays](http://www.howto.gov/web-content/usability/first-fridays) Product Testing Program, a discount usability testing session designed to find and fix usability problems on [DOL.gov](http://www.dol.gov).

The experience led the DOL web team to [improve DOL.gov](http://social.dol.gov/blog/improving-our-website), including changing their search engine.

So it was satisfying to learn that they decided to use USASearch to power the search on DOL.gov. The basis of their decision to select USASearch is exactly what we hope motivates each agency to use USASearch.

> The 'out of the box' search results are much more relevant than our prior search results because it harnesses the power of a world-class search engine and the program offers us a great amount of control for suggesting the best links for certain search results and ensuring that new content or breaking news is included in the search results.

Thank you, DOL!

Date: 7:02pm - 7:49pm ET March 5, 2020<br />
Details: Beginning 7:02pm ET, an outage at our hosting provider prevented us from distributing incoming requests to our servers. Their issue was resolved, but in addition, a database update by them to an unused feature caused our internal requests to fail. We applied an update to match their update, and service was restored.

Date: 8:00 pm October 29 - 10:15 am October 30, 2019<br />
Details: Beginning 8 PM ET 10/29, search sites using certain search features began returning errors for all searches. During our planned maintenance, our infrastructure host deployed routing settings to more servers than we requested, and this caused the error. After reverting the routing setting, all search sites are now behaving normally.

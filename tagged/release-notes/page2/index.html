<ul>
  <li>To accomplish our <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">FY 2018 goals</a>, we continued backend development that will allow your agency content to be sent directly into our indexes. In October, our team completed work that enables our system to process PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We completed our transition to Chef 12.</li>
  <li>We updated our program website to be https://search.gov/. As part of that process, we changed our website favicon to our new logo, updated references to our program on individual pages, and created a new <a href="/manual/cname.html">domain mask</a>.</li>
  <li>We updated the attribution at the bottom of search results pages that display content from our indexes. Those pages now say “Powered by Search.gov.”</li>
  <li>We began transitioning our repos to use Circle CI.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our hosted search results pages are 508 compliant, and we undergo regular review to ensure compliance. This month, we added underlining to the links that are displayed in the headers, footers, and navigation bars on our search results pages. The underlining appears when you hover over the link, and indicates that the links are not regular text.<br />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We announced the changes coming to our program in FY 2018. Read our <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">blog post</a> and <a href="/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To accomplish our FY 2018 goals, we continued backend development that will allow your agency content to be sent directly into our indexes. In September, our team investigated multiple tools that can fetch website content, parse it, and send it into our Elasticsearch indexes. We also completed work that will ensure our new system follows “noindex” meta tags and headers if they are present on your website.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We upgraded our Ruby version to 2.3.5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We prepared to transition our program website to the <a href="https://search.gov/">search.gov</a> domain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We deactivated any users who had not accessed the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Search Admin Center</a> within the past year. We notified inactive users prior to deactivating their accounts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Agencies can send content directly to our indexes via our <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y API</a>. Previously, each document had to have a created date. Now, this field is optional. Review our <a href="/developer/indexing-api.html">technical documentation</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We continued work on backend features that will provide new ways for customer content to be sent directly into our own indexes. In August, our team created a rake task that will allow our system to fetch, parse, and index a list of URLs. We also investigated the spellchecker functionality in Elasticsearch. This is a long term project that extends through the rest of this calendar year and into 2018. Stay tuned!</p>

  <li>
    <p>Take complete control of your search results! We released the dev Drupal 8 version of our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a>. The module hooks your CMS into <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a>, our content indexing API. Through i14y,  you can send content directly to our indexes. No commercial web results are served: instead, searchers will see content exactly as you’ve sent it to us. Go to our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal project page</a> to try it out, and <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">reach out to our team</a> with questions.</p>

  <li>With our new bot blocker feature, we discovered that the CAPTCHA page didn’t work for human searchers who don’t have Javascript enabled, and searchers did not see an error. We added an error message to instruct these searchers to temporarily enable Javascript in order to complete the CAPTCHA prompt.</li>

  <li>What type of traffic do we not like in our system? Bots. Bots run junk queries on your search boxes, gobbling up our query purchases with the commercial search engines. To battle the bots, we launched a bot-blocking feature:
    <ul>
      <li>If an IP address sends high levels of traffic to a particular search site in a short amount of time, the searcher will be asked to confirm that they are human via CAPTCHA (screenshot below).</li>
      <li>The CAPTCHA is unlikely to trigger for humans.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Our developer team continues to investigate and roadmap the best way to get customer content into our own indexes. This will be a long term project that extends through the rest of this calendar year and into 2018. There are several advantages to using our own indexes:

      <li>Customers can have complete control over what content is included in their search results.</li>
      <li>Customers don’t need to rely on results from commercial indexes, which can be out of date or have unpredictable titles/descriptions.</li>

Previously, deactivated users who attempted to log-in to our system and/or reset their passwords were redirected to the USA.gov homepage.

  <li>We hosted a webinar covering the current ways that customers can directly index their content with our service: via <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Supplemental RSS feed</a>, <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y API</a> or via the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a> that connects with our API.

Previously, every item had to have a description. Now, descriptions are optional. If there is no description for an item, we’ll display snippets taken from an item’s full text. If a description is provided, we’ll show the description if it has a match with the query; otherwise, we’ll show snippets from the full text. Note: descriptions are still required for our <a href="/manual/rss.html">main RSS feed</a> feature.</li>

<ul>
  <li>As of March 1st, we only support federal and District of Columbia websites. We wrapped up our behind-the-scenes work that facilitated this transition.</li>
  <li>Google announced that it is <a href="https://enterprise.google.com/search/products/gss.html">deprecating the Google Site Search API</a>. We use the GSS API to serve Google results in the limited cases where Bing results are not sufficient. We’ve renewed our license and will continue to use GSS until its end date of March 31, 2018. We are investigating how to best mitigate the effect of this deprecation.</li>
  <li>A new help manual page has been added for our <a href="/manual/analytics-alerts.html">Analytics Alert</a> feature. We also revised the pages for <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">adding supplemental content</a> to your search site and <a href="/manual/filter-content.html">filtering URLs</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed internal reports that allow us to track when agencies launch our service on their sites.</li>

<h3 id="i14y-drawer-management">i14y Drawer Management</h3>

<p>We updated the process for removing <a href="/manual/i14y-drawers.html">i14y Drawers</a> from a search configuration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you remove a drawer that is associated with only one search configuration, it will be deleted from our system.</li>
  <li>If you remove a drawer that is attached to multiple search configurations, it will be removed from only the one configuration and will remain attached to the others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-results-page-platform-launches">New Results Page Platform Launches</h3>

<p>We launched our new JavaScript search results page, which is serving the search results on IRS.gov.</p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Have your RSS feeds transitioned from <code>HTTP</code> to <code>HTTPS</code>? Our system now recognizes that transition automatically.</li>
  <li>We indexed and support the search for whitehouse.gov. We prepared indexes to go live at noon January 20, for the obamawhitehouse.archives.gov sites, as well as the new content on whitehouse.gov.</li>
  <li>We’ve updated the process around password reset links.
    <ul>
      <li>Password reset links are only valid for one hour: previously, if you requested a password reset link more than once within the hour, the first link would expire. This caused confusion for many users who accidentally hit the reset link twice and were encountering expired links.</li>
      <li>Now, we will resend you the first, valid link for a period of one hour, regardless of how many times you hit the reset button.</li>
      <li>We’ve also updated and clarified the message you see if you click an expired link.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We finalized adding all our active repos to the <a href="https://code.gov">Code.gov</a> inventory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Our excellent asset caching was inadvertently prolonging transient errors by serving up cached error responses. We’ve fixed this so errors will really go away when they’ve cleared.</li>
  <li>We also added a response code passthrough to make sure that, in our multiserver environment, we don’t end up returning <code>200</code> responses just because an error page is working just fine. We are now passing through the response code reported by the error page.</li>
  <li>We fixed a bug where some password reset tokens were delivering users to the login page, when they should have been delivered to the password reset page.</li>
  <li>We fixed an error that was interfering with our import of Federal Register documents for indexing.</li>
</ul>

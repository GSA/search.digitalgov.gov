      <h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Customers can use our <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Supplemental RSS Feed</a> and <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html#supplemental-urls">Supplemental URLs</a> feature to add missing content to their search results or to have complete control over what content appears. Previously, every item had to have a description. Now, descriptions are optional. If there is no description for an item, we’ll display snippets taken from an item’s full text. If a description is provided, we’ll show the description if it has a match with the query; otherwise, we’ll show snippets from the full text. Note: descriptions are still required for our <a href="/manual/rss.html">main RSS feed</a> feature.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>As of March 1st, we only support federal and District of Columbia websites. We wrapped up our behind-the-scenes work that facilitated this transition.</li>
<li>Google announced that it is <a href="https://enterprise.google.com/search/products/gss.html">deprecating the Google Site Search API</a>. We use the GSS API to serve Google results in the limited cases where Bing results are not sufficient. We’ve renewed our license and will continue to use GSS until its end date of March 31, 2018. We are investigating how to best mitigate the effect of this deprecation.</li>
<li>A new help manual page has been added for our <a href="/manual/analytics-alerts.html">Analytics Alert</a> feature. We also revised the pages for <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">adding supplemental content</a> to your search site and <a href="/manual/filter-content.html">filtering URLs</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Users who were deactivated from our system still received <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Daily Snapshot</a> emails of their site’s activity. This has been corrected, and deactivated users no longer receive those emails.</li>
<li>On March 17th, our system was offline for 1 hour. We traced the problem to a specific configuration in our new logging mechanism. We mitigated the issue and will ensure the long term solution is stable.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If you change your email address, we will now send a verification link to the new address.</li>
<li>We now offer a Kazakh language search results page.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>As of March 1st, we only support federal and District of Columbia websites. We’ve done a lot of behind-the-scenes work to support our non-federal customers during the past few months of transition.</li>
<li>We’ve added our active repos to <a href="https://code.gov/">Code.gov</a>, a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the federal government.</li>
<li>Our sysadmins reduced the size of our Elasticsearch server cluster, saving money while maintaining system integrity.</li>
<li>We removed old code from our system, wrapping up tasks from our December transition to Bing’s newest API.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed internal reports that allow us to track when agencies launch our service on their sites.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug that affected the indexing of some <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter accounts</a>.</li>

      <h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>JavaScript Search Results Page</h3>

<p>Our new JavaScript search results page was released in Beta. This new results page platform allows us to offer more layout options, to better complement our customers' site layouts. The first layout released matches the current default layout.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/new-serp-classic-template.png" alt="New JavaScript results page" width="100%"/></p>

<h3>Crawling and Indexing</h3>

<p>We are exploring how we can use our own crawler for a subset of our customers' search configurations. The goal is to serve more results directly from our own indexes, rather than leveraging commercial indexes. We recognize that not all agency customers are able to send us their content via API or RSS, and we also recognize that agencies are interested in having more control over when their content gets indexed, which is not possible with the commercial crawlers.</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>In August, our development team successfully migrated Search’s infrastructure to AWS. We continue to make updates to the new environment, including ClamAV scanning and new VPCs. Other work around our ATO includes:

<ul>
<li>Nessus scanner work</li>
<li>Re-IP'ing our system to integrate with GSA's new log archiving system</li>
<li>Password management and handling updates, now requiring complex passwords, updates every 90 days, and displaying ambiguous login error messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We continue to assist customers with <a href="/manual/https-transition.html">transitioning to HTTPS</a>, adding <a href="/manual/cname.html">sites’ domain masks</a> to our SSL certificate and preparing to update our help manual and some backend configurations.</li>
<li>When you <a href="/manual/clone-site.html">clone a search configuration</a>, your type-ahead suggestions will no longer clone to the new configuration. This enables your new site to populate type-ahead suggestions based on its own traffic.</li>
<li>In December, Bing is <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bingdevcenter/2016/11/04/azure-data-market-bing-search-and-web-results-only-apis-to-be-decommissioned-december-15/">deprecating 2 of its APIs</a>. We’re handling this transition for all search configurations that use our hosted search results page. We began preparing for the transition this month and will complete work prior to the December 15th deprecation.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Email verification links were redirecting infinitely, causing some new users to be unable to get into the system.</li>
<li>We fixed a conflict for our customers who may share machines with other users, so now if a user is logged in and another user attempts to verify their account, the original user will be logged out so the second user can complete their verification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>i14y Drawer Management</h3>

<p>We updated the process for removing <a href="/manual/i14y-drawers.html">i14y Drawers</a> from a search configuration.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you remove a drawer that is associated with only one search configuration, it will be deleted from our system.</li>
<li>If you remove a drawer that is attached to multiple search configurations, it will be removed from only the one configuration and will remain attached to the others.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New Results Page Platform Launches</h3>

<p>We launched our new JavaScript search results page, which is serving the search results on IRS.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/new-serp.png" alt="New JavaScript results page" width="100%"/></p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>Have your RSS feeds transitioned from <code>HTTP</code> to <code>HTTPS</code>? Our system now recognizes that transition automatically.</li>
<li>We indexed and support the search for whitehouse.gov. We prepared indexes to go live at noon January 20, for the obamawhitehouse.archives.gov sites, as well as the new content on whitehouse.gov.</li>
<li>We’ve updated the process around password reset links.

<ul>
<li>Password reset links are only valid for one hour: previously, if you requested a password reset link more than once within the hour, the first link would expire. This caused confusion for many users who accidentally hit the reset link twice and were encountering expired links.</li>
<li>Now, we will resend you the first, valid link for a period of one hour, regardless of how many times you hit the reset button.</li>
<li>We’ve also updated and clarified the message you see if you click an expired link.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We finalized adding all our active repos to the <a href="https://code.gov">Code.gov</a> inventory.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Our excellent asset caching was inadvertently prolonging transient errors by serving up cached error responses. We’ve fixed this so errors will really go away when they’ve cleared.</li>
<li>We also added a response code passthrough to make sure that, in our multiserver environment, we don't end up returning <code>200</code> responses just because an error page is working just fine. We are now passing through the response code reported by the error page.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug where some password reset tokens were delivering users to the login page, when they should have been delivered to the password reset page.</li>
<li>We fixed an error that was interfering with our import of Federal Register documents for indexing.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>Password Management</h3>

<p>The password change page now requires confirmation of your previous password. We also now require complex passwords, including 8 or more characters, and a combination of character types and cases.</p>

<h3>Crawling and Indexing</h3>

<p>We are exploring how we can use our own crawler for a subset of our customers' search configurations. The goal is to serve more results directly from our own indexes, rather than leveraging commercial indexes. We recognize that not all agency customers are able to send us their content via API or RSS, and we also recognize that agencies are interested in having more control over when their content gets indexed, which is not possible with the commercial crawlers.</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>On December 15th, Bing <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bingdevcenter/2016/11/04/azure-data-market-bing-search-and-web-results-only-apis-to-be-decommissioned-december-15/">deprecated 2 of its APIs</a>. We successfully (and invisibly!) handled this transition for all search configurations that use our hosted search results page.

<ul>
<li>Related to this, we updated our search results API instructions in our Admin Center.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In line with the <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">HTTPS-only mandate</a>, we are now serving traffic only over <code>HTTPS</code>. We updated our <a href="/manual/">help manual</a> and the code snippets you see in the Admin Center to reflect this change.</li>
<li>We ran (and are continuing to run) bulk updates to some URLs that are still listed as <code>HTTP</code> in our system but can be accessed over <code>HTTPS</code>.  This bulk update applies to URLs in the following features:

<ul>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>Supplemental URLs</li>
<li>Supplemental RSS feeds</li>
<li>Best Bets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Our new JavaScript search results page now appears correctly in all modern versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer, and on both Windows and Mac computers.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where our multi-server AWS environment was interfering with our <a href="govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/vocab/index.php">Government URLs inventory database</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed an error that was blocking our uploads to Bing's temporary index.</li>

      <h2>2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>1. Tools for Filtering Results</h3>

<p>The display of search results pages is constantly evolving. Some changes are subtle. Others are more noticeable.</p>

<p>In line with industry best practices and commercial search engines, we've moved the tools for filtering and sorting results to the top of results list (rather than on the left side). We've also added an option to clear all filters.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/search-tools.png" alt="Tools for filtering and sorting" /></p>

<h3>2. Access Your Raw Logs</h3>

<p>You can now access your raw HTTP logs. These logs contain valuable data on searches, clicks and discovery tag page loads.</p>

<p>Read <em>How to Access Your Raw Logs</em> for more details about how to request secure FTP access to your logs.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers now see the most current titles and descriptions available for <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube videos</a> and they won't see any deleted videos.</li>
<li>Visitors to the pages search.usa.gov and buscador.usa.gov are now automatically redirected to <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa">GobiernoUSA.gov</a>, respectively, so they see the most recent content on these homepages.</li>
<li>Spanish searchers now see <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov">plain language</a> helper text.</li>
<li>Searchers no longer see two search boxes on the search results page, which will create a more visually appealing and usable page.</li>
<li>We open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls Server API</a> in Github.</li>
<li>Searchers are now able to search and see results from collections that are not visible in the left-hand navigation on your "main" web results. You can use this option to provide a search box on a small subset of content (such as a policy manual or meeting minutes) while not cluttering up the left-hand navigation on your main results page. (It also helps reduce the likelihood that searchers experience a "dead end" on your main results page.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We rewrote some query routing rules for job searches to present more precise results in the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a>.</li>
<li>We configured <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a> to enable continuous integration for the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls Server API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs Server API</a>.</li>

      <h2>Federal Register Documents Are Now Available</h2>

<p>Federal agencies publish notices, proposed rules, and final rules in the <em><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">Federal Register</a></em>. To make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in government decision-making, we created the <em>Federal Register</em> module to help searchers find these notices and rules.</p>

<p>This GovBox offers direct access to <em>Federal Register</em> documents. We pull the data from the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers">Federal Register API</a> to provide timely information across all documents.</p>

<p>If you <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">opt to show the Federal Register</a> module, searchers looking for topics on your site can readily find the notices and rules that your agency has published in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<p>The full title will be shown within the search results and when <em>Federal Register</em> documents have been posted by multiple agencies, searchers will see both agencies listed.</p>

<p>Documents with open comment periods will appear before relevant documents with closed comment periods. The status of the comment period will be noted in the results. At the bottom of the page, there is a link to see more <em>Federal Register</em> documents.</p>

      <h2>New Feature: Check the Status of Your RSS Feeds</h2>

<p>You now see better, more complete messages about the status of your RSS feeds in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> under Manage Content > RSS.</p>

<p>Yellow indicates the status is pending. Green indicates the feed has been crawled and the status is OK. Red indicates there's an issue with your feed or at least one item within your feed.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/rss-status.png" title="RSS status messages and colors" alt="RSS status messages and colors" /></p>

<p>Click on the name of the feed to see more detailed information about its status. Possible error messages follow.</p>

<ul>
<li>404 Not Found</li>
<li>Feed looks empty</li>
<li>Description can't be blank</li>
<li>Title can't be blank</li>
<li>Missing link field</li>
<li>Missing pubDate field</li>
<li>Link is not a valid URL</li>
<li>Linked URL does not exist (HTTP 404)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers now see the search box and navigation options within the body of the results page, not the header.</li>
<li>Searchers now see results from <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a> when their search term matches text within the feed's <code>content:encoded</code> element. The <code>content:encoded</code> element is optional and defines the full content of an item. Read recommendations for this element in the RSS Advisory Board's <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-profile#namespace-elements-content-encoded"><em>Really Simple Syndication Best Practices Profile</em> for content:encoded</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>

<li>Searchers now see images with an exact phrase match above those with the words scattered throughout their metadata. For example, visitors searching on a multi-word term like <em>jefferson memorial</em> now see the result for "county event at Jefferson Memorial" above the one for "memorial event in Jefferson County." [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/9a0ab9c3a44da931d8aee2595ff35053381870e2">Commit 9a0ab9c</a>]</li>

<li>Searchers on USA.gov now see government-wide video results. See, for example, <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/news?affiliate=usagov&amp;channel=617&amp;query=lincoln">video results for <em>lincoln</em> on USA.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>

<li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/elasticsearch-1-3-4-released/">Elasticsearch 1.3.4</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and applied <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> updates to our operating system.</li>
<li>We now reindex images with zero downtime. [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/6387825883ba17f75916019480019ed31cfb1a9c">Commit 6387825</a>]</li>
<li>We updated the synonyms for our image index to improve recall and return even more relevant pictures. [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/7de29e528aab2bb031576107829f5981fc2af6f9">Commit 7de29e5</a>]</li>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<li>Searchers now see spelling suggestions on results pages for <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a>. They'd previously seen them on the main results page only.</li>
<li>We now re-import Flickr and Instagram photos for up to 30 days to update their popularity. [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/02f0a83887e02d5d11fc50caed6547dcaf1461ba">Commit 02f0a83</a>]</li>
<li>We reduced the font size for the tagline (which you can set on the Display > <a href="/manual/brand.html">Header &amp; Footer</a> page in the Admin Center).</li>

<li>We updated <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a> thumbnails to use https, not http.</li>
<li>We no longer return web results for searches that are too long (> 60 characters), use only an asterisk, or use placeholder text (such as <em>What are you looking for?</em> and <em>Search Our Site</em>). Searchers now see a message to try a shorter query or to enter a search term.</li>
<li><a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best bets</a> must include a description. The field can't be blank.</li>

      <h2>Promote Related Content as Value-Added Links</h2>

<p>To help searchers more easily find what they're looking for, you can now promote related content by listing it as a set of value-added links under your organic web results. See the sample results page below that shows value-added links for EDGAR filings for a search on <em>apple</em> on SEC.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/sitelink.png" title="Sitelink-generated links for EDGAR filings on SEC.gov" alt="Sitelink-generated links for EDGAR filings on SEC.gov" /></p>

<p>Do you have related content that you'd like to display as value-added links that searchers should see within the context of each other (such as related forms, instructions, and publications)? If your related content follows a discernable URL pattern, email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#115;&#101;&#x61;&#x72;&#x63;&#104;&#x40;&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x69;&#x67;&#x69;&#x74;&#97;&#x6c;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;">&#115;&#x65;&#x61;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#x2e;&#x64;&#105;&#x67;&#105;&#x74;&#97;&#x6c;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#46;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;</a> and we'll work with you to promote the related content on your site.</p>

<p>We've open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator">code for the sitelink generator</a> on Github so you can <a href="https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator/fork">fork the code</a> and contribute to it directly. We've also <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/sitelink_generator">published it as Ruby gem</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks, <a href="http://www.sec.gov">SEC.gov</a> team, for helping us build this new feature!</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Searchers now see underlined links when they hover over them on the results page.</li>
<li>Searchers using screen readers now see an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> alert for type-ahead search suggestions to let them know the number of available suggestions and how to access them.</li>
<li>You can now add a tagline at the top of your results page. See the sample tagline, <em>NIJ.gov - Strengthen Science. Advance Justice.</em>, on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=national-institute-of-justice&amp;query=dna">NIJ.gov's results page</a>.</li>
<li>You can now left-align your hamburger menu. See the sample left-aligned menu on <a href="http://search.whitehouse.gov/search?affiliate=wh&amp;query=bo">WhiteHouse.gov's results page</a>. (Perhaps needed because <a href="http://time.com/3107557/top-10-lefties/">Obama is a leftie</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>?)</li>
<li>You can now add an alt tag to your logo on the <a href="/manual/brand.html">Image Assets</a> page in the Admin Center.</li>
<li>To improve its accessibility, you now see legends and instructional text for all radio button options in the Admin Center. You can also tab logically through all menu items.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>We upgraded to version 4.0 of the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/airbrake">Airbrake gem</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and version 6.5 of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. We also installed patches to address the <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-268A">Shellshock vulnerability</a>.</li>
<li>We gained 40% more capacity in our main Elasticsearch cluster by upgrading our hardware.</li>
<li>We removed infinite scroll on the results page.</li>
<li>We now redirect searchers to USA.gov's 404 page when they use a null or incorrect 'affiliate' parameter.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We've added a user agent to our request headers so you can see it when we poll your RSS feeds.</li>
<li>If you've opted to turn off web tracking, we now turn off the tags for both our own Google Analytics and the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a>.</li>
<li>We now show fewer similar or duplicate pictures in our image results. [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/f6ab91539efa965325dbe02b6c67ff68a7dff431">Commit f6ab915</a>]</li>
<li>We fixed our image search pagination to account for really old pictures and how we group photos into albums. [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/b12eb198c900d0d1a00c06a017477114b003489c">Commit b12eb19</a>]</li>
<li>We also fixed our indexing of images with circa dates. [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/f7b577c21daed4ac5b00711a70028602c4117d72">Commit f7b577c</a>]</li>
<li>We lessened the complexity of the importer logic for Instagram. [<a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/5f828e3e426d66300fcff574ffecff262e9b4d73">Commit 5f828e3</a>]</li>
<li>The option to narrow results to images only now appears by default for sites with an Instagram account. It had previously displayed only for sites with a Flickr account.</li>
<li>Searchers no longer see government-wide image results on sites without a Flickr or Instagram account. They now see site-specific image results.</li>
<li>Image searches without a search term no longer cause an error.</li>

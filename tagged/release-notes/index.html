    <div class='post-content'>
      <h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>We’ve begun work on backend features that will provide new ways for customer content to be sent directly into our own indexes. In July, a new index was set up in our system. We also investigated ways to fetch, parse, and send data to our indexes. This is a long term project that extends through the rest of this calendar year and into 2018. Stay tuned!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We wrapped up refinements to our bot-blocking feature that was <a href="/releases/may-2017.html">released in May</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We continued work that will upgrade our server recipes to Chef 12 and our Ruby version to 2.3.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>As part of our compliance with Section 508 law, we increased the size of facet text on our search results pages. The guideline is that text should be at least 13 pixels, and our facet text is now 13.125 pixels.</li>
</ul>

    </h1>
    

    <div class='post-content'>
      <h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Take complete control of your search results! We released the dev Drupal 8 version of our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a>. The module hooks your CMS into <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a>, our content indexing API. Through i14y,  you can send content directly to our indexes. No commercial web results are served: instead, searchers will see content exactly as you've sent it to us. Go to our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal project page</a> to try it out, and <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">reach out to our team</a> with questions.</p></li>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We continue to refine our bot-blocking feature that was <a href="/releases/may-2017.html">released in May</a>. We are excited at the success of the feature and are continuing to stop new ‘junk’ queries from being entered into your search forms.</p></li>
<li><p>We began updating our server recipes to Chef 12 and our Ruby version to 2.3.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>With our new bot blocker feature, we discovered that the CAPTCHA page didn’t work for human searchers who don't have Javascript enabled, and searchers did not see an error. We added an error message to instruct these searchers to temporarily enable Javascript in order to complete the CAPTCHA prompt.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>What type of traffic do we not like in our system? Bots. Bots run junk queries on your search boxes, gobbling up our query purchases with the commercial search engines. To battle the bots, we launched a bot-blocking feature:

<ul>
<li>If an IP address sends high levels of traffic to a particular search site in a short amount of time, the searcher will be asked to confirm that they are human via CAPTCHA (screenshot below).</li>
<li>The CAPTCHA is unlikely to trigger for humans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>Our developer team continues to investigate and roadmap the best way to get customer content into our own indexes. This will be a long term project that extends through the rest of this calendar year and into 2018. There are several advantages to using our own indexes:

<ul>
<li>Customers can have complete control over what content is included in their search results.</li>
<li>Customers don’t need to rely on results from commercial indexes, which can be out of date or have unpredictable titles/descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>

    <div class='post-content'>
      <h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>We deactivate user accounts for customers who are no longer at their agency, do not have a search site set up, have never verified their email, or have not logged in to their account for more than a year. Previously, deactivated users who attempted to log-in to our system and/or reset their passwords were redirected to the USA.gov homepage. Now, deactivated users see a message, alerting them to contact our team.</li>
<li>We hosted a webinar covering the current ways that customers can directly index their content with our service: via <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Supplemental RSS feed</a>, <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y API</a> or via the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a> that connects with our API. We’ll post the recording in the <a href="/manual/training.html">Training</a> section of our website as soon as it is available.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>Our developer team began a sprint investigating the best way to get customer content into our own indexes. There are several advantages to using our own indexes:

<ul>
<li>Customers can have complete control over what content is included in their search results.</li>
<li>Customers don’t need to rely on results from commercial indexes, which can be out of date or have unpredictable titles/descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Our <a href="/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a> was briefly offline on Thursday, April 27th (from approximately 4:50 pm - 5:40 pm). A DNS update made by another program in our division caused the outage, which was immediately caught by our alerting system and rectified.</li>

      <h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Customers can use our <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Supplemental RSS Feed</a> and <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html#supplemental-urls">Supplemental URLs</a> feature to add missing content to their search results or to have complete control over what content appears. Previously, every item had to have a description. Now, descriptions are optional. If there is no description for an item, we’ll display snippets taken from an item’s full text. If a description is provided, we’ll show the description if it has a match with the query; otherwise, we’ll show snippets from the full text. Note: descriptions are still required for our <a href="/manual/rss.html">main RSS feed</a> feature.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>As of March 1st, we only support federal and District of Columbia websites. We wrapped up our behind-the-scenes work that facilitated this transition.</li>
<li>Google announced that it is <a href="https://enterprise.google.com/search/products/gss.html">deprecating the Google Site Search API</a>. We use the GSS API to serve Google results in the limited cases where Bing results are not sufficient. We’ve renewed our license and will continue to use GSS until its end date of March 31, 2018. We are investigating how to best mitigate the effect of this deprecation.</li>
<li>A new help manual page has been added for our <a href="/manual/analytics-alerts.html">Analytics Alert</a> feature. We also revised the pages for <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">adding supplemental content</a> to your search site and <a href="/manual/filter-content.html">filtering URLs</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Users who were deactivated from our system still received <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Daily Snapshot</a> emails of their site’s activity. This has been corrected, and deactivated users no longer receive those emails.</li>
<li>On March 17th, our system was offline for 1 hour. We traced the problem to a specific configuration in our new logging mechanism. We mitigated the issue and will ensure the long term solution is stable.</li>
</ul>

<li>We now offer a Kazakh language search results page.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>As of March 1st, we only support federal and District of Columbia websites. We’ve done a lot of behind-the-scenes work to support our non-federal customers during the past few months of transition.</li>
<li>We’ve added our active repos to <a href="https://code.gov/">Code.gov</a>, a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the federal government.</li>
<li>Our sysadmins reduced the size of our Elasticsearch server cluster, saving money while maintaining system integrity.</li>
<li>We removed old code from our system, wrapping up tasks from our December transition to Bing’s newest API.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We fixed internal reports that allow us to track when agencies launch our service on their sites.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug that affected the indexing of some <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter accounts</a>.</li>

<h3>i14y Drawer Management</h3>

<p>We updated the process for removing <a href="/manual/i14y-drawers.html">i14y Drawers</a> from a search configuration.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you remove a drawer that is associated with only one search configuration, it will be deleted from our system.</li>
<li>If you remove a drawer that is attached to multiple search configurations, it will be removed from only the one configuration and will remain attached to the others.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New Results Page Platform Launches</h3>

<p>We launched our new JavaScript search results page, which is serving the search results on IRS.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/new-serp.png" alt="New JavaScript results page" width="100%"/></p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>Have your RSS feeds transitioned from <code>HTTP</code> to <code>HTTPS</code>? Our system now recognizes that transition automatically.</li>
<li>We indexed and support the search for whitehouse.gov. We prepared indexes to go live at noon January 20, for the obamawhitehouse.archives.gov sites, as well as the new content on whitehouse.gov.</li>
<li>We’ve updated the process around password reset links.

<ul>
<li>Password reset links are only valid for one hour: previously, if you requested a password reset link more than once within the hour, the first link would expire. This caused confusion for many users who accidentally hit the reset link twice and were encountering expired links.</li>
<li>Now, we will resend you the first, valid link for a period of one hour, regardless of how many times you hit the reset button.</li>
<li>We’ve also updated and clarified the message you see if you click an expired link.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We finalized adding all our active repos to the <a href="https://code.gov">Code.gov</a> inventory.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Our excellent asset caching was inadvertently prolonging transient errors by serving up cached error responses. We’ve fixed this so errors will really go away when they’ve cleared.</li>
<li>We also added a response code passthrough to make sure that, in our multiserver environment, we don't end up returning <code>200</code> responses just because an error page is working just fine. We are now passing through the response code reported by the error page.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug where some password reset tokens were delivering users to the login page, when they should have been delivered to the password reset page.</li>
<li>We fixed an error that was interfering with our import of Federal Register documents for indexing.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3>Password Management</h3>

<p>The password change page now requires confirmation of your previous password. We also now require complex passwords, including 8 or more characters, and a combination of character types and cases.</p>

<h3>Crawling and Indexing</h3>

<p>We are exploring how we can use our own crawler for a subset of our customers' search configurations. The goal is to serve more results directly from our own indexes, rather than leveraging commercial indexes. We recognize that not all agency customers are able to send us their content via API or RSS, and we also recognize that agencies are interested in having more control over when their content gets indexed, which is not possible with the commercial crawlers.</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>On December 15th, Bing <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bingdevcenter/2016/11/04/azure-data-market-bing-search-and-web-results-only-apis-to-be-decommissioned-december-15/">deprecated 2 of its APIs</a>. We successfully (and invisibly!) handled this transition for all search configurations that use our hosted search results page.

<ul>
<li>Related to this, we updated our search results API instructions in our Admin Center.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In line with the <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">HTTPS-only mandate</a>, we are now serving traffic only over <code>HTTPS</code>. We updated our <a href="/manual/">help manual</a> and the code snippets you see in the Admin Center to reflect this change.</li>
<li>We ran (and are continuing to run) bulk updates to some URLs that are still listed as <code>HTTP</code> in our system but can be accessed over <code>HTTPS</code>.  This bulk update applies to URLs in the following features:

<ul>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>Supplemental URLs</li>
<li>Supplemental RSS feeds</li>
<li>Best Bets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Our new JavaScript search results page now appears correctly in all modern versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer, and on both Windows and Mac computers.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where our multi-server AWS environment was interfering with our <a href="govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/vocab/index.php">Government URLs inventory database</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed an error that was blocking our uploads to Bing's temporary index.</li>

<p>Our new JavaScript search results page was released in Beta. This new results page platform allows us to offer more layout options, to better complement our customers' site layouts. The first layout released matches the current default layout.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/new-serp-classic-template.png" alt="New JavaScript results page" width="100%"/></p>

<h3>Crawling and Indexing</h3>

<p>We are exploring how we can use our own crawler for a subset of our customers' search configurations. The goal is to serve more results directly from our own indexes, rather than leveraging commercial indexes. We recognize that not all agency customers are able to send us their content via API or RSS, and we also recognize that agencies are interested in having more control over when their content gets indexed, which is not possible with the commercial crawlers.</p>

<h2>Chores</h2>

<ul>
<li>In August, our development team successfully migrated Search’s infrastructure to AWS. We continue to make updates to the new environment, including ClamAV scanning and new VPCs. Other work around our ATO includes:

<ul>
<li>Nessus scanner work</li>
<li>Re-IP'ing our system to integrate with GSA's new log archiving system</li>
<li>Password management and handling updates, now requiring complex passwords, updates every 90 days, and displaying ambiguous login error messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We continue to assist customers with <a href="/manual/https-transition.html">transitioning to HTTPS</a>, adding <a href="/manual/cname.html">sites’ domain masks</a> to our SSL certificate and preparing to update our help manual and some backend configurations.</li>
<li>When you <a href="/manual/clone-site.html">clone a search configuration</a>, your type-ahead suggestions will no longer clone to the new configuration. This enables your new site to populate type-ahead suggestions based on its own traffic.</li>
<li>In December, Bing is <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bingdevcenter/2016/11/04/azure-data-market-bing-search-and-web-results-only-apis-to-be-decommissioned-december-15/">deprecating 2 of its APIs</a>. We’re handling this transition for all search configurations that use our hosted search results page. We began preparing for the transition this month and will complete work prior to the December 15th deprecation.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Email verification links were redirecting infinitely, causing some new users to be unable to get into the system.</li>
<li>We fixed a conflict for our customers who may share machines with other users, so now if a user is logged in and another user attempts to verify their account, the original user will be logged out so the second user can complete their verification.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps">XML sitemap</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> is an XML formatted file containing a list of URLs on a website. An XML sitemap provides information that allows a search engine to index your website more intelligently, and to keep its search index up to date.</p>

<p>Sitemaps tell search engines what URLs are on a website, and, if URLs are added as they are published, they tell the engines what new content needs to be picked up. They may also provide additional metadata about each URL, such as the last modified date, which signals to the engine to update the index record for that page.</p>

<p>Search.gov uses sitemaps to tell us what URLs should be in our index and when a URL has been updated. Sitemaps are used in a similar way by <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184">Google</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, Bing, and and other search engines. <em>Having an xml sitemap will improve your Google SEO (search engine optimization).</em></p>

<p>Example: <a href="https://search.gov/sitemap.xml">https://search.gov/sitemap.xml</a></p>

<h2 id="what-content-should-be-on-xml-sitemap">What content should be on XML sitemap?</h2>

<p>Some sitemaps are comprehensive, but for very large sites you may need to publish several sitemaps. Each sitemap should be no more than 50MB or 50,000 URLs, whichever comes first. You do not need to add URLs of content you want to remain unsearchable.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that an HTML formatted file listing the pages of a site is more akin to an index page, and is not the same as an XML sitemap. HTML files are human friendly, but not machine friendly, and Search engines need an xml formatted file in order to leverage the information for indexing work.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-one-web-platform-use-multiple-sitemaps">More than one web platform? Use multiple sitemaps.</h2>

<p>It’s common for agencies to use more than one platform to publish their websites. For instance, a CMS was launched, but some content is still on the legacy site’s platform. In this case, use available plugins for the CMS’s in your environment to auto-generate sitemaps for that content. Manually generate a sitemap for any static content. You can publish a <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#index">sitemap index file</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> that lists the locations of all your specific sitemaps, or you can list all your sitemaps on your robots.txt file.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-search-engines-find-my-sitemaps">How do search engines find my sitemap(s)?</h2>

<p>Sitemaps (or the <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#index">sitemap index</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>) should be listed in your site’s robots.txt file, i.e.:<br />
<code>Sitemap: https://www.agency.gov/sitemap_1.xml</code><br />
<code>Sitemap: https://www.agency.gov/sitemap_2.xml</code></p>

<p>List the appropriate sitemap(s) for the domain or subdomain. <code>www.exampleagency.gov/robots.txt</code> would list sitemaps for content in the <code>www</code> subdomain, while <code>forms.exampleagency.gov/robots.txt</code> would list sitemaps for the <code>forms</code> subdomain.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://search.gov/blog/robotstxt.html">robots.txt files</a>, and take a look at ours: <a href="https://search.gov/robots.txt">https://search.gov/robots.txt</a></p>

<h2 id="what-should-my-xml-sitemap-look-like">What should my XML sitemap look like?</h2>

<p>Please refer to the official <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">sitemaps protocol</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> for full information on how a sitemap should be structured.</p>

<p>When publishing your sitemap, be sure it begins with an <code>&lt;xml&gt;</code> declaration, and that the URLs are enclosed in opening and closing tags. To take a simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;urlset&gt;
&lt;url&gt;
&lt;loc&gt;https://exampleagency.gov/blog/file1.html&lt;/loc&gt;
&lt;lastmod&gt;2018-03-19T00:00:00+00:00&lt;/lastmod&gt;
&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;url&gt;
&lt;loc&gt;https://exampleagency.gov/policy/new-policy.html&lt;/loc&gt;
&lt;lastmod&gt;2018-03-27T00:00:00+00:00&lt;/lastmod&gt;
&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/urlset&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you use multiple sitemaps, then you’ll need to use a <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#index">sitemap index</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;sitemapindex&gt;
&lt;sitemap&gt;https://exampleagency.gov/sitemap.xml?page=1&lt;/sitemap&gt;
&lt;sitemap&gt;https://exampleagency.gov/sitemap.xml?page=2&lt;/sitemap&gt;
&lt;/sitemapindex&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Importantly, be sure that any <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#escaping">special characters in your URLs are escaped</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> so the search engines will know how to read them.</p>

<h2 id="what-metadata-does-searchgov-require-for-each-xml-sitemap-url">What metadata does Search.gov require for each XML sitemap URL?</h2>

<p>The sitemap protocol defines <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions">required and optional XML tags</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> for each URL. We recommend including the <code>&lt;lastmod&gt;</code> value (the date of last modification of the file) whenever possible, to indicate when a file has been updated and needs to be re-indexed.</p>

<p>We do not have plans to support the <code>&lt;priority&gt;</code> tag, which is <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-priority-change-frequency-xml-sitemap-20273.html">no longer used</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> by search engines like Google. We may support the <code>&lt;changefreq&gt;</code> tag in the future, but the <code>&lt;lastmod&gt;</code> tag is more accurate and supported by more search engines.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-create-an-xml-sitemap">How can I create an XML sitemap?</h2>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Robots.txt Files]]></title>
    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/robotstxt.html"/>
    <updated>2020-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/robotstxt.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <code>/robots.txt</code> file is a text file that instructs automated web bots on how to crawl and/or index a website. Web teams use them to provide information about what site directories should or should not be crawled, how quickly content should be accessed, and which bots are welcome on the site.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-my-robotstxt-file-look-like">What should my robots.txt file look like?</h2>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">robots.txt protocol</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> for detailed information on how and where to create your robots.txt. Key points to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file must be located at the root of the domain, and each subdomain needs its own file.</li>
  <li>The robots.txt protocol is case sensitive.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to accidentally block crawling of everything
    <ul>
      <li><code>Disallow: /</code> means disallow everything</li>
      <li><code>Disallow:  </code> means disallow nothing, thus allowing everything</li>
      <li><code>Allow: /</code> means allow everything</li>
      <li><code>Allow:  </code> means allow nothing, thus disallowing everything</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The instructions in robots.txt are guidance for bots, not binding requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-can-i-optimize-my-robotstxt-for-searchgov">How can I optimize my robots.txt for Search.gov?</h2>

<h3 id="crawl-delay">Crawl delay</h3>
<p>A robots.txt file may specify a “crawl delay” directive for one or more user agents, which tells a bot how quickly it can request pages from a website. For example, a crawl delay of 10 specifies that a crawler should not request a new page more than every 10 seconds.</p>

<pre><code>  500,000 URLs
     x 10 seconds between requests
5,000,000 seconds for all requests

5,000,000 seconds = 58 days to index the site once.
</code></pre>

<p>We recommend a crawl-delay of 2 seconds for our <code>usasearch</code> user agent, and setting a higher crawl delay for all other bots. The lower the crawl delay, the faster Search.gov will be able to index your site. In the robots.txt file, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>User-agent: usasearch  
Crawl-delay: 2

User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
</code></pre>

<h3 id="xml-sitemaps">XML Sitemaps</h3>
<p>Your robots.txt file should also list one or more of your <a href="https://search.gov/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Sitemap: https://www.exampleagency.gov/sitemap.xml
Sitemap: https://www.exampleagency.gov/independent-subsection-sitemap.xml
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>Only list sitemaps for the domain matching where the robots.txt file is. A different subdomain’s sitemap should be listed on that subdomain’s robots.txt.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="allow-only-the-content-that-you-want-searchable">Allow only the content that you want searchable</h3>
<p>We recommend disallowing any directories or files that should not be searchable. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Disallow: /archive/
Disallow: /news-1997/
Disallow: /reports/duplicative-page.html
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Note that if you disallow a directory after it’s been indexed by a search engine, this may not trigger a removal of that content from the index. You’ll need to go into the search engine’s webmaster tools to request removal.</li>
  <li>Also note that search engines may index individual pages within a disallowed folder if the search engine learns about the URL from a non-crawl method, like a link from another site or your sitemap. To ensure a given page is not searchable, set a <a href="/blog/how-search-engines-index-content-better-discoverability.html#robots">robots meta tag</a> on that page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="customize-settings-for-different-bots">Customize settings for different bots</h3>
<p>You can set different permissions for different bots. For example, if you want us to index your archived content but don’t want Google or Bing to index it, you can specify that:</p>

<pre><code>User-agent: usasearch  
Crawl-delay: 2
Allow: /archive/

User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Disallow: /archive/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="robotstxt-checklist">Robots.txt checklist</h2>
<p><i class="icon-check"></i> 1. A robots.txt file has been created in the site’s root directory (<code>https://exampleagency.gov/robots.txt</code>)</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> 2. The robots.txt file disallows any directories and files that automated bots should not crawl</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> 3. The robots.txt file lists one or more <a href="https://search.gov/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a></p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> 4. The robots.txt file format has been <a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/webtools/sitemap-validator/">validated</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></p>

    <id>https://search.gov/manual/redesign.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We often receive questions when an agency conducts a major website upgrade, changes content management systems, or both. We created this checklist to help ensure your redesign is successful. The stages are:</p>

<p><strong>Ready…</strong></p>

<p>1. <a href="#contact-us">Let the Search.gov team know you are launching a new site</a></p>

<p>2. <a href="#develop-plan">Develop a reindexing plan</a></p>

<p><strong>Set…</strong></p>

<p>3. <a href="#prep-seo">Prepare xml sitemaps and SEO elements</a></p>

<p>4. <a href="#search-page-alert">Add a Search Page Alert</a></p>

<p>5. <a href="#update-brand">Prepare color scheme updates and new logo to add to Admin Center</a></p>

<p>6. <a href="#update-features">Prepare updates to your other search features</a></p>

<p><strong>Go!</strong></p>

<p>7. <a href="#go-live">Flip the new website live, let us know</a></p>

<p>8. <a href="#parallel-tracks">Implement the changes to the search site</a></p>

<p>9. <a href="#results-show">Results begin to show</a></p>

<p><a name="description"></a></p>

<h2 id="ready">Ready…</h2>

<p><a name="contact-us"></a></p>

<h3 id="1-let-the-searchgov-team-know-you-are-launching-a-new-site">1. Let the Search.gov team know you are launching a new site</h3>

<p><strong>Who:</strong>  You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Send us an <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email</a>, give us a call, either way, please let us know that you’re working on a redesign of your website. If we know ahead of time, we can help you get your new search experience prepped and in good shape on the day of the relaunch. When you reach out to us, include the planned launch date.</p>

<p>It’s important to plan ahead, because if there are any changes to your site structure, your search results will break, which will lead to frustration for the public as they try to use your new site. This is true for our service, and out on Google and Bing. To avoid an avalanche of <code>404 not found</code> errors from your search results, wherever possible, use 301 redirects to send visitors from the old pages to the appropriate new pages. For more on 301 redirects, read tips from <a href="http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2011/10/06/managing-redirects-301s-302s-and-canonicals/">Bing</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633">Google</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. Notify other websites that link to you of the changes.</p>

<p><a name="develop-plan"></a></p>

<h3 id="2-develop-a-reindexing-plan">2. Develop a reindexing plan</h3>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> Search.gov team, in consultation with you, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> We will ask you about your search needs for the new site, including what domains you need to include, how you can generate an <a href="https://search.gov/blog/sitemaps.html">xml sitemap</a>, and what SEO supports you’re putting in place in your new templates, like <a href="https://search.gov/manual/metadata.html">metadata</a> and <a href="https://search.gov/manual/how-search-engines-index-content-better-discoverability.html">other structured elements</a>. Read more about our <a href="https://search.gov/manual/site-launch-guide.html#indexing-workflow">indexing process here</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this discussion, we’ll make some recommendations and likely agree on some action items for your team to consider implementing prior to your launch. If there are any major SEO warning signs in your setup, we’ll let you know.</p>

<p>We’ll also ask you about the timeline for launch, so that we can reserve a time to coordinate <a href="#parallel-tracks">Step 8</a> with you.</p>

<h2 id="set">Set…</h2>

<p><a name="prep-seo"></a></p>

<h3 id="3-prepare-xml-sitemaps-and-seo-elements">3. Prepare xml sitemaps and SEO elements</h3>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Action items that usually come out of the planning discussions include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that each domain and subdomain you want to be searchable launches with an <a href="https://search.gov/blog/sitemaps.html">xml sitemap</a>.</li>
  <li>Add <a href="https://search.gov/manual/metadata.html">metadata</a> blocks to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your page templates, and Semantic Markup to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes these pieces are in place, but need to be modified or moved.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Talk with other web teams to ask them to do the above items on their sites, so you can leverage them when your site searches their site’s content.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="search-page-alert"></a></p>

<h3 id="4-add-a-search-page-alert-in-the-admin-center">4. Add a Search Page Alert in the Admin Center</h3>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Use our <a href="https://search.gov/manual/system-alert.html">Search Page Alert</a> feature to display a “pardon our dust” type message on your results page. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>We are launching a new example.gov. If your search does not return the content you expected, please check back soon for updated results.</code></li>
  <li>Set the status of the alert to <code>Inactive</code> and wait for the relaunch.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="add-features"></a></p>

<h3 id="5-prepare-color-scheme-updates-and-new-logo-to-add-to-admin-center">5. Prepare color scheme updates and new logo to add to Admin Center</h3>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Gather your <a href="https://search.gov/manual/brand.html">new logo and color palette</a>, if needed. Many sites find it helpful to mock up their redesigned results page in a non-production search site - you can either <a href="https://search.gov/manual/clone-site.html">clone</a> your existing site or just use the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/add-site.html">Add Site</a> button to create a totally new one.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t implement</strong> these changes on your production site ahead of the actual relaunch (that comes in <a href="#parallel-tracks">Step 8</a>, below).</p>

<p><a name="update-features"></a></p>

<h3 id="6-prepare-updates-to-your-other-search-features">6. Prepare updates to your other search features</h3>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> When your URL structure changes, this will affect several of our search features. You’ll want to get your updates ready to go, but <strong>don’t implement</strong> them ahead of the relaunch, or people will end up in the wrong places:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/domains.html">Domains</a>: make sure your Domains list includes the domains and subdomains that you want included as the default content to search.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/collections.html">Collections</a>: make sure your Collections are searching for the right content in the new location.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets</a>: make sure your Best Bet URLs are correct for the content’s new location.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/routed-queries.html">Routed Queries</a>: update the target of your Routed Queries, so searchers will end up on the correct page.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds should be removed, and re-added from their new locations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="go">Go!</h2>

<p><a name="go-live"></a></p>

<h3 id="7-flip-the-new-website-live-and-let-us-know">7. Flip the new website live, and let us know</h3>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> When your new website is publicly available, reach out to us by email or phone. This will be our signal to begin our part of <a href="#parallel-tracks">Step 8</a>.</p>

<p><a name="parallel-tracks"></a></p>

<h3 id="8-implement-the-changes-to-the-search-site">8. Implement the changes to the search site</h3>

<p>At this point, the work splits into two parallel tracks, with your team and ours working on related items at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Add the updates you prepared in Steps 4, 5, and 6 to the Admin Center for your production search site:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set your Search Page Alert to <code>Active</code></li>
  <li>Update your colors and logo</li>
  <li>Update your Domains, Collections, Best Bets, Routed Queries, and RSS Feeds as necessary</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> The Search.gov team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> We complete several backend tasks</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switch your production search site to use the new index, which will begin empty for your domain(s).</li>
  <li>Tell our indexer to begin working on your domain(s)
    <ul>
      <li>The time it takes to get your content indexed depends on the number of items you have, and whether you have a crawl delay declared in your <code>/robots.txt</code> file. Generally speaking, a few hundred items should be done in an hour or two, a few thousand items should be done in several hours, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="go-live"></a></p>

<h3 id="9-results-begin-to-show">9. Results begin to show</h3>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Our indexer will first read your sitemap, collect the urls, and then work through them in the order they were collected. We will work at the crawl delay set in your <code>/robots.txt</code> file, or 1 request per second, whichever is slower. This delay is the time after we’ve rendered a page, before requesting the next page to render.</p>

    <updated>2019-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/june-2019.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increasing indexing coverage</strong> We now index pages with only title metadata. Previously, we required pages include either content or description metadata in order to be indexed. This was to ensure we indexed pages with more complete information. However, this limited relevant content included on Javascript pages and similar client-side rendered pages.
    <ul>
      <li>As you include title metadata, it’s important keep them short and on-topic without packing in repeated information such as agency name. If you want to include your agency name, we recommend you place it after the page title. More information on metadata and tags you should include <a href="https://search.gov/manual/metadata.html">is available here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Improving USAJOBS Integration</strong> Common government terms “federal” and “gobierno” no longer trigger our USAJOBS integration. Previously, queries that included these terms triggered our integration with USAJOBS to display relevant postings. However, these queries often resulted in no or irrelevant job postings.</li>
  <li><strong>Service upgrades</strong> We continued to upgrade components of our service, including ElasticSearch, Rails, and Ruby to improve the overall performance of our indexing system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Language parsing bug fix</strong> We fixed a bug that parsed non-English pages (e.g. Greek) incorrectly or not at all. This particularly affected pages containing mathematical formulas and equations.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>90 day Account Deactivations:</strong> We now deactivate accounts for users who haven’t logged into Search.gov in the last 90 days. If you are unable to login should contact us via search@support.digitalgov.gov to reactivate your accounts. Contractors who do not use .gov or .mil email addresses will be asked to have their government POC re-confirm their status.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved stability:</strong> We stabilized search performance by removing unnecessary content from our indices to free up memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Service upgrades:</strong> We continued to upgrade components of our service, including ElasticSearch, Rails, and Ruby to improve the overall performance of our indexing system.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-.gov Government Domains Inventory:</strong> We decommissioned the old tool we used to manage the inventory of domains in use by federal agencies outside of the .gov and .mil top level domains. We transferred the data to GitHub, where it will be easier for agency staff to contribute to the inventory. More information is <a href="https://search.gov/developer/govt-urls.html">available on our website</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Image search result bug fix:</strong> We fixed a bug that prevented images sent to our index via Media RSS from being displayed in search results.</li>
  <li><strong>Video search results bug fix:</strong> We fixed a bug that prevented videos from appearing in some search results pages.</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How Search.gov Ranks Your Search Results]]></title>
    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/ranking-factors.html"/>
    <updated>2019-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/ranking-factors.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google and Bing hold their ranking algorithms closely as trade secrets, as a guard against people trying to game the system to ensure their own content comes out on top, regardless of whether that’s appropriate to the search. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) consulting has grown up as an industry to try to help websites get the best possible placement in search results.  You may be interested in our webinars on <a href="https://search.gov/manual/training.html#site-structure-better-seo">technical SEO</a> and <a href="https://search.gov/manual/training.html#search-doctor">best practices</a> that will help you get your website into better shape for search, and we’re also available to advise federal web teams on particular search issues. Generally speaking, though, SEO is a lot like reading tea leaves.</p>

<p>We at Search.gov share our ranking factors because we want you to game our system. This helps ensure that the best, most appropriate content rises to the top of search results to help the American public find what they need.</p>

<p>This page will be updated as new ranking factors are added.</p>

<h2 id="guaranteed-1st-place-spot">Guaranteed 1st Place Spot</h2>

<p>For any pages you want always to appear in the top of search results, regardless of what the ranking algorithm might decide, use a <a href="https://search.gov/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bet</a>. Like an ad in the commercial engines, Best Bets allow you to pin recommended pages to the top of results. Text Best Bets are for single pages, and Graphics Best Bets allow you to boost a set of related items. Our <code>Match Keywords Only</code> feature allows you to put a tight focus on the terms you want a Best Bet to respond to. <a href="https://search.gov/manual/best-bets.html">Read more here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ranking-factors">Ranking Factors</h2>

<p>Each of the following ranking factors is calculated separately, and then multiplied together to create the final ranking score of a given item for a given search.</p>

<h3 id="file-type">File Type</h3>

<p>We prefer HTML documents over other file types. Non-HTML results are demoted significantly, to prevent, for instance, PDF files from crowding out their respective landing pages.</p>

<h3 id="freshness">Freshness</h3>

<p>We prefer documents that are fresh. Anything published or updated in the past 30 days is considered fresh. After that, we use a Gaussian decay function to demote documents, so that the older a document is, the more it is demoted. When documents are 5 years old or older, we consider them to be equally old and do not demote further. We use either the <code>article:modified_time</code> on an individual page, or that page’s <code>&lt;lastmod&gt;</code> date from the sitemap, whichever is more recent. If there is only an <code>article:published_time</code> for a given page, we use that date.</p>

<p>Documents with no date metadata at all are considered fresh and are not demoted. <a href="https://search.gov/manual/metadata.html">Read more about date metadata</a> we collect and why it’s important to add metadata to your files.</p>

<h3 id="page-popularity">Page Popularity</h3>

<p>We prefer documents that users interact with more. Currently we leverage our own search analytics to track the number of times a URL is clicked on from the results page. The more clicks, the more that URL is promoted, or boosted. We use a logarithmic function to determine how much to boost the relevance score for each URL. For sites new to our service, please expect this ranking factor to take 30 days to fully warm up after your search goes live.</p>

<p>Note: Sites using the search results API to present our results on their own websites will not be able to take advantage of our click data ranking.</p>

<h3 id="core-ranking-algorithm">Core Ranking Algorithm</h3>

<p>Our system is built on Elasticsearch, which itself is built on Apache Lucene. For the first several generations, Elasticsearch used Lucene’s default ranking, the Practical Scoring Function. This Function starts with a basic Boolean match for single terms and adds in TF/IDF and a vector space model. Here are some high level definitions for these technical terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Boolean matches</strong> are the AND / OR / NOT matches you’ve probably heard about.
    <ul>
      <li>This AND that</li>
      <li>This OR that</li>
      <li>This NOT that</li>
      <li>This AND (that OR foo) NOT bar</li>
      <li><strong>Note</strong> that while the relevance ranking takes these into account, we do not currently use these operators if entered by a searcher. Support for user-entered Boolean operators is coming in 2019.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>TF/IDF</strong> means term frequency / inverse document frequency. It counts the number of times a term appears in a document, and compares it to how many documents have that word. It aims to identify documents where the query terms appear frequently, and documents with more rare terms across the whole set of documents will get a higher score. Documents with a lot of common terms appearing in many documents will get a lower score.
    <ul>
      <li>They also have tempered the TF/IDF score with a method called <strong>BM25</strong>, which attempts to balance the TF/IDF scores of documents that are very different in length. If there are ten documents containing rare terms, the longest doc with the most instances of the terms would get a much higher score than a short doc with only a few instances of the terms. This makes intuitive sense, but when considered as a full pdf of a report vs the summary of the report, the full report isn’t that much more relevant to the query than the summary is. BM25’s length ‘normalizatin’ addresses that issue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>vector space model</strong> allows the search engine to weight the individual terms in the query, so a common term in the query would receive a lower match score than a rare term in the query.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/practical-scoring-function.html">Read detailed technical documentation here</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i></li>
</ul>

<p>The latest versions of Elasticsearch takes into account the context of terms within the document, whether they are in structured data fields or in unstructured fields, like body text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structured data fields, like dates, are treated with a Boolean match method - does the field value match, or not?</li>
  <li>Unstructured data fields, like webpage body content, are considered for how well a document matches a query.</li>

    <link href="https://search.gov/releases/may-2019.html"/>
    <updated>2019-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/may-2019.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sitelimit parameter support</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Now our customers can specify that a search box only returns results from a particular part of their site. For example, for site www.example.gov,  you want a search box on your site to only return results from <code>www.example.gov/history</code>. By adding the appropriate URL parameter and value, you can limit results: <code>&amp;sitelimit=www.example.gov/history</code>.</li>
      <li>You can also specify multiple values for the sitelimit. See this <a href="https://www.nps.gov/search/?affiliate=nps&amp;query=seneca&amp;sitelimit=www.nps.gov/subjects/oceans+www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory">example from the National Park Service</a>.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that the sitelimit must be for a domain within your site’s index. That is, if the Domains list includes <code>www.example.gov</code>, the sitelimit parameter cannot be <code>www.agency.gov/history</code>.</li>
      <li>This feature is an alternative to our Collections feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Service upgrades</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We continued to upgrade components of our service, including ElasticSearch, Rails, and Ruby to improve the overall performance of our indexing system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Highlighting bug</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We fixed a bug that prevented highlighting for exact, phrased queries on sites indexed by Search.gov. <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=usasearch&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=%22search+features%22">Here’s an example of it working correctly now</a>.</li>

    <id>https://search.gov/releases/april-2019.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We launched updated Freshness ranking for customers indexed by Search.gov. The fresher a page the more likely it is to be promoted. Previously, we only factored the date a page is created into its freshness. Now, we first factor the date a page was last modified and then, the date a page is created. This new feature highlights the importance of ensuring that metadata on your site’s pages and sitemap is accurate. Here is more information about how we rank your search results: https://search.gov/manual/ranking-factors.html</li>
  <li>We continued to upgrade components of our service, including ElasticSearch, Rails, and Ruby to improve the overall performance of our indexing system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes-and-chores">Fixes and Chores</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that made it difficult to view sidebar items on the search results page when hovering over individual links. Now, the experience when hovering over these links is fully accessible.</li>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/what-searchgov-indexes.html"/>
    <updated>2019-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/what-searchgov-indexes.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>When we think about indexing pages for search, we usually think about indexing the primary content of the page. But if the page isn’t structured to tell the search engine where that content is to be found, it will collect the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, and then filter out the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements, if present. If <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> are not present, we collect the full contents of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. Learn more on our post about aiming search engines at the content you really want to be searchable, using <a href="https://search.gov/manual/how-search-engines-index-content-better-discoverability.html#main-element">the &lt;/main&gt; element</a>.</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://search.gov/manual/metadata.html">read more detail on each of the following elements here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="standard-metadata-elements">Standard metadata elements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>meta description</li>
  <li>meta keywords</li>
  <li>locale or language (from the opening <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag)</li>
  <li>url</li>
  <li>lastmod (collected from XML sitemaps)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-graph-protocol-external-link-elements"><a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph protocol</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> elements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>og:description</li>
  <li>og:title</li>
  <li>article:published_time</li>
  <li>article:modified_time</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="file-formats">File formats</h2>

<p>In addition to HTML pages with their various file extensions, Search.gov indexes the following file types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PDFs</li>
  <li>Word docs</li>
  <li>Excel docs</li>
  <li>TXT</li>
  <li>Images can be indexed either using our <a href="https://search.gov/manual/flickr.html">Flickr integration</a>, or by sending us an <a href="https://search.gov/manual/rss.html">MRSS feed</a>. Note that images are not indexed during web page indexing, so you’ll need to use one of these two methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming soon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Powerpoint</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that at this time we cannot index javascript content, <a href="https://moz.com/blog/search-engines-ready-for-javascript-crawling">similar to most search engines</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. At this time we recommend your team adds well crafted, unique description text for each of your pages, or perhaps auto-generate description tag text from the first few lines of the article text. However the text is added, it should include the keywords you want the page to respond to in search, framed in plain language. This will give us, and other search engines, something to work with when we’re matching and ranking results. See our discussion of description <a href="https://search.gov/manual/metadata.html">metadata</a> for more information.</p>

    <updated>2019-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/metadata.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Search.gov, like other search engines, relies on structured data to help inform how we index your content and how it is presented in search results. You should also read up on the metadata and structured data used by <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/79812?hl=en">Google</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/marking-up-your-site-with-structured-data-3a93e731">Bing</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>Including the following tags and metadata in each of your pages will improve the quality of your content’s indexing, as well as results ranking. We also encourage you to read about more <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/">HTML5 semantic markup</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> you can include in your websites.</p>

<p>This page will be updated over time as we add more tag-based indexing functions and ranking factors to our service.</p>

<p><code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> Unique title of the page. If you want to include the agency or section name, place that after the actual page title.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Query matching, term frequency scoring<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;meta name=”description” content=”foo” /&gt;</code> 
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Your well crafted, plain language summary of the page content. This will often be used by search engines in place of a page snippet. Be sure to include the keywords you want the page to rank well for. Best to limit to 160 characters, so it will not be truncated. <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description">Read more here</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Query matching, term frequency scoring<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;meta name=”keywords” content=”foo bar baz ” /&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> While not often used by commercial search engines due to <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66358?hl=en">keyword stuffing</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, Search.gov indexes your keywords, if you have added them.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Query matching, term frequency scoring<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;meta property="og:title” content=”Title goes here” /&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> Usually duplicative of <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, we use the <code>og:title</code> property as the result title if it appears to be more substantive than the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag. Note, Open Graph elements are used to display previews of your content in FaceBook and some other social media platforms.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Query matching, term frequency scoring<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;meta property="og:description” content=”Description goes here” /&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> Often duplicative of the meta description, we index this field as well, in case it has different content. This field is a good opportunity to include more keywords than you could write into the meta description. Note, Open Graph elements are used to display previews of your content in FaceBook and some other social media platforms.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Query matching, term frequency scoring<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;meta property="article:published_time" content="YYYY-MM-DD" /&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> Exact time is optional; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">read more here</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Page freshness scoring.<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;meta property="article:modified_time" content="YYYY-MM-DD" /&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> Exact time is optional; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">read more here</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Page freshness scoring.<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="..., ..." /&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> Use the <a href="https://search.gov/blog/how-search-engines-index-content-better-discoverability.html#robots">meta robots tag</a> to block the search engine from indexing a particular page.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Used during indexing, does not affect relevance ranking.<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;main&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> Allows the search engine to target the actual content of the page and avoid headers, sidebars and other page content not useful to search. <a href="https://search.gov/blog/how-search-engines-index-content-better-discoverability.html#main-element">Read more about the &lt;main&gt; element here</a>
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Query matching, term frequency scoring<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;lastmod&gt;</code>
<br /><strong>Detail:</strong> This field is included in XML sitemaps to signal to search engines when a page was last modified. Search.gov collects this metadata in case there is no <code>article:modified_time</code> data included in the page itself.
<br /><strong>Used in:</strong> Indexing processing, page freshness scoring.<br />

<p><a name="description"></a></p>

<p><a name="add-site"></a></p>

<h2 id="1-add-site">1. Add Site</h2>

<p><strong>Who:</strong>  You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> After you’ve successfully opened an account with Search.gov, you’ll need to create a search site. A search site is where you configure the search experience for your website. Find the <code>Add Site</code> link at the top of the Admin Center, and enter some basic details about your site. Please note that our service is for publicly accessible, federal government content. More detailed information can be found on our <a href="https://search.gov/manual/add-site.html">Add Site help page</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve created your site, note the actions available on the left-hand navigation of your Admin Center.</p>

<p><i class="icon-dashboard"></i> The <strong>Dashboard</strong> is where you can view a Site Overview, manage users, update your site’s homepage, or site display name.</p>

<p><i class="icon-bar-chart"></i> <strong>Analytics</strong> are provided for the past 13 months, reporting your top queries, clicks, and referrers (the pages people were on when they ran their searches), and monthly rollup data.</p>

<p><i class="icon-file"></i> <strong>Content</strong> management is where you define what your search experience will include, both the default search scope, additional content sources, and alternative search views.</p>

<p><i class="icon-desktop"></i> <strong>Display</strong> management is where you can configure the branding of your search results page.</p>

<p><i class="icon-eye-open"></i> <strong>Preview</strong> your search results page to see what your search experience will be like, before you go live.</p>

<p><i class="icon-code"></i> And finally, the <strong>Activate</strong> section provides pre-formatted code snippets to help you go live. Don’t be afraid of entering this area, nothing will actually be activated.</p>

<p><a name="add-domains"></a>
<br /></p>
<h2 id="2-add-domains">2. Add Domains</h2>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> In the content management section, the domains list defines the default search scope for your site. You can include one domain or several, or you can focus on particular subdomains of one domain. <a href="https://search.gov/manual/domains.html">Read more here</a>.</p>

<p><a name="select-index"></a>
<br /></p>
<h2 id="3-web-index-selection">3. Web Index Selection</h2>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> Search.gov team, in consultation with you, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> By default a new search site will be connected to the Bing web index to receive web results. Websites with very low levels of search traffic can continue to use the Bing web index after they launched our service. However, sites that will see greater than 150,000 queries per year will need to be indexed directly by our service before going live.  We monitor new sites established in our system, and will reach out if we think your site will need to be indexed by us, or if we need more information to make a determination.</p>

<p>Regardless of the index used to support your search, we can only serve publicly accessible content. You will not be able to use our service for secure content, including intranets, and we can never index or serve personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential data.</p>

<p>(<a href="#add-features">Jump to Step 4. Add Features</a> if you don’t need the details of the indexing process at this time.)</p>

<p>If we will be indexing your content ourselves, we will follow these steps:
<a name="indexing-workflow"></a></p>

<p><br /><br /></p>
<h3 id="indexing-with-searchgov">Indexing with Search.gov</h3>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h4 id="a-define-domains-and-subdomains">A. Define Domains and Subdomains</h4>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team, in consultation with the Search.gov team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> The Admin Center Domains list controls what we pull out of our index for a search on your site. But we also need to know what to put in to the index to begin with. We’ll work with you to confirm the domains and subdomains you want discoverable through search. For example, after discussing with you, we may plan to index all of your subdomains, or just a selection of the major sections:</p>

<pre><code>www.example.gov
data.example.gov
archive.example.gov
www.subagencydomainexample.gov 
</code></pre>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h4 id="b-sitemap-for-each-subdomain">B. Sitemap for Each Subdomain</h4>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team, in consultation with the Search.gov team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> The easiest way for us to discover what URLs exist on your domain is via an XML sitemap. Each domain identified above will need a separate sitemap. Please read our <a href="https://search.gov/blog/sitemaps.html">detailed discussion of XML sitemaps</a>, and let us know if you have any questions. We understand it can be difficult for some legacy systems to generate a sitemaps, so if this is the case, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">please reach out</a>.</p>

<p>We do not crawl websites by default due to the high resource demand of crawling every page on every website all the time. One of the goals of our service is to contain the costs of search government-wide, and a crawling-first model would increase costs significantly.</p>

<p>If you publish your site on Federalist, read these <a href="https://search.gov/manual/searchgov-for-federalist.html">additional instructions</a>.
<br /><br /></p>
<h4 id="c-index-subdomains">C. Index Subdomains</h4>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> The Search.gov team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Once sitemaps are posted to your website, our system will index your content. Alert us when the sitemaps are posted, and we’ll add your domains to our list of domains that we monitor. Then, indexing will begin.</p>

<p>By default, we make 1 request per second to a domain. If a <code>Crawl-delay</code> is declared in your <a href="https://search.gov/blog/robotstxt.html">/robots.txt file</a>, we will honor that delay while fetching your content for indexing. The length of time required to index a site is <code>(number of items) x (crawl delay) / 3600 = hours to index</code>.</p>

<p>If you use a firewall service, it’s possible our indexer will be blocked. We can provide our IP addresses for you to whitelist in your firewall.</p>

<p>Please note, we can only index domains that are publicly accessible. This means that if you have a password-protected staging environment, we will not be able to index it for you as part of your testing process. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Please reach out</a> and we can discuss options if you need to test our service pre-production.
<br /><br /></p>
<h4 id="d-test-index">D. Test Index</h4>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> Search.gov Team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> For search sites switching from Bing: After your content is indexed, we’ll start up a parallel search site using your current site configuration and the new index, and run a number of test queries to ensure the index is performing satisfactorily. Our test will cover your live site’s most popular queries. 
<br /><br /></p>
<h4 id="e-review-index">E. Review Index</h4>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> For sites switching from Bing: After we’re satisfied with the index, we’ll send you a link to the test search site, so you can review and provide feedback.</p>

<p>For brand new sites: You will be able to test the index using your regular search site(s).

<h4 id="f-ready-to-launch">F. Ready to Launch</h4>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team, in collaboration with Search.gov</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong>  For brand new sites: Your index is ready to go, you can proceed with the rest of the site launch steps and go live without any further action from our team.</p>

<p>For sites switching from Bing: When you give us the green light to switch to the new index, there is no action needed on your part other than the approval. We will change a setting in our back end, which will point your existing search site’s web results module to our index, and the change is effective immediately. All other elements of your search site remain the same: search features, branding, etc.</p>

<p><a name="add-features"></a>
<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="4-add-search-features">4. Add Search Features</h2>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> We offer several additional search features you can configure to enhance your search experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/collections.html">Collections</a> allow you to set up alternative search scopes from the Domains you declare for the main search. Often Collections point at particular subfolders or subdomains of the primary domain for the site. Sometimes they point at a different domain entirely. If you are indexed by Searhc.gov and you want a Collection to search another domain, check with us to see if we have that content already indexed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets</a> work like ads in Google, and allow you to pin certain results to the top of your search results. Use Text Best Bets to boost individual items, and Graphics Best Bets to boost a set of related items, such as a form, its instructions page, and other related material.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/routed-queries.html">Routed queries</a> allow you to bypass the results page entirely for a given query, where you know exactly the page you want a person to get to after running that query. This is helpful for always getting people to the landing page for a process, rather than their clicking to a mid-process page from a search results page.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds can be indexed and searched either as separate tabs on the search results, or as an inline module promoting your latest content alongside your web results.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a> videos can also be searched</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs</a> are one of the most frequently searched topics on agency websites. Use our jobs module to show your agency’s postings from USAJOBS in your own website’s search results.</li>
  <li><a href="https://search.gov/manual/govbox-federal-register.html"><em>Federal Register</em></a> rules and notices can be added to your search results in a separate module.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="turn-features-on"></a>
<br /></p>
<h2 id="5-toggle-search-features-on">5. Toggle Search Features On</h2>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> In order to display any of the search features you just added above, you’ll need to toggle ON the display for each one, using the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview page</a>. If you want to show Jobs or <em>Federal Register</em> results and you don’t see those options on the Display Overview page, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">let us know</a> and we can connect your search site to those features.</p>

<p><a name="configure-branding"></a>
<br /></p>
<h2 id="6-configure-results-page">6. Configure Results Page</h2>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> To make the results page complement your website’s look and feel, upload your logo, set the font style, and customize the page colors to ensure a more seamless experience for your searchers as they move from your site to ours, and back again. You can also add header and footer links to support navigation back to your website. <a href="https://search.gov/manual/brand.html">See more details here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://search.gov/manual/cname.html">Masking the domain for your results page</a> is another way you can provide continuity to your searchers as they move back and forth between your site and our system.</p>

<p><a name="go-live"></a>
<br /></p>
<h2 id="7-connect-your-search-box-to-searchgov">7. Connect Your Search Box to Search.gov</h2>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> You, the agency web team, in collaboration with your deploy team, if different</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Once you’re ready to go live with your search site, take a look at the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/go-live.html">Go-Live Checklist</a> to make sure you’ve covered all your bases. Then you will need to modify the form code for the search box on your website. We provide simple pre-formatted code in the Admin Center, or you can include these same parameters in another style of search box. <a href="https://search.gov/manual/code.html">Read more and see required parameters here</a>.</p>

<p>If you publish your site on Federalist, read these <a href="https://search.gov/manual/searchgov-for-federalist.html">alternative instructions</a>.</p>

<p>You’re now live with Search.gov!</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/sitemaps-to-search-sites.html"/>
    <updated>2019-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/sitemaps-to-search-sites.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We often get questions about how sitemaps control the search results for a given site. The answer is, they don’t! This page will describe to you the relationship between sitemaps, search indexes, and the search experiences you create through the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-frame-for-the-relationships-described-below">A frame for the relationships described below</h2>

<p>Imagine a big lake. There are any number of tributaries feeding into the lake. There are fishing boats out on the lake, each loaded up with the gear they need and a guide to the kinds of fish they’re trying to catch.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-searchgov-index-the-lake">The Big Search.gov Index: the Lake</h2>

<p>Like a lake with its fish, the common search index has all the content from all the sites we index, ready to be brought up by any number of different search site configurations.</p>

<p>The main difference in the search site setup process is the source of the web results. Like Google and Bing, when we index your content, we collect every site’s web pages into a big, common index. All search sites using our index reference this same common data pool.</p>

<h2 id="sitemaps-the-tributaries">Sitemaps: the Tributaries</h2>

<p><a href="https://search.gov/manual/sitemaps.html">XML Sitemaps</a> are like tributaries feeding into a lake. They do not feed into sitemap-specific indexes connected to particular search sites.</p>

<p>Sitemaps list the content available on websites in a machine-friendly format, so that search engines will know what to collect from the site. The <a href="https://search.gov/manual/indexing-with-searchgov.html">content indexed</a> from your website goes into the big index mentioned above, along with the content from all other websites. You can, in theory, pull content from any website we have indexed into your search experience. This supports portal search experiences.</p>

<h2 id="search-site-setup-the-fishing-boats">Search Site Setup: the Fishing Boats</h2>

<p>Like a fishing boat on the water, you’ve decided what fish you’re going after, you know what corners of the lake to go to, and you’ve collected the gear you need to get the fish.</p>

<p>Search.gov used to rely on the Bing web index for our main search results. Customers would log in to the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> and use the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> list to include the content they wanted to pull from Bing. Now that we’re building our index in house, all this remains the same. You log in to the Admin Center and configure what you want your search to return on the results page.</p>

<h2 id="tying-it-all-together">Tying it all together</h2>

<p>We use sitemaps to inform what we index into our system. You use the Admin Center to determine what results will come out of the index when people search on your website.
Tributaries feed into a lake, and fishers can go out to any part of the lake to get the particular kinds of fish that they want.</p>

<p>Following a particular page through this cycle looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A page is posted to a website</li>
  <li>Its URL is added to the sitemap</li>
  <li>Search.gov’s indexer reads the sitemap and picks up the URL</li>
  <li>Search.gov’s indexer visits the page and <a href="https://search.gov/manual/what-searchgov-indexes.html">scrapes the content</a></li>
  <li>The content is added to the index. Meanwhile, the search site had already been configured to include this content within the index.</li>
  <li>A member of the public searches on the website</li>
  <li>The query matches the page’s content</li>
  <li>The page is returned as a search result</li>
  <li>The searcher clicks on the URL on the results page</li>
  <li>
    <p>The searcher is brought to the page on the website</p>

    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/files/sitemaps-to-search-results.png" alt="Diagram showing a large circle, representing the Search.gov website. To the left of the circle is an array of small blocks, each representing an individual sitemap. Arrows point from the sitemaps to the large circle. To the right of the circle is a set of pentagons representing search sites. To the right of these is a vertical bar representing the Public. Arrows flow from the circle, through the pentagon and end at the bar, representing the flow of search results from the central Search.gov index through the search sites to the members of the public who are searching." /></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Website structure and content can have a significant impact on the ability of search engines to provide a good search experience. As a result, the Search Engine Optimization industry evolved to provide better understanding of these impacts and close critical gaps. Some elements on your website will actively hinder the search experience, and this post will show you how to target valuable content and exclude distractions.</p>

<p>We’ve written a <a href="https://search.gov/manual/robotstxt.html">post about robots.txt files</a>, talking about high level inclusion and exclusion of content from search engines. There are other key tools you will want to employ on your website to further target the content on individual pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#main-element">The &lt;main&gt; element</a></li>
  <li><a href="#rel-canonical">Canonical links</a></li>
  <li><a href="#robots">Robots meta tags</a></li>
  <li>Or a combination of the above: <a href="#sample">Sample code structure for dynamic lists and an archived event</a></li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<a id="main-element"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-main-element">The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element</h2>

<h3 id="targeting-particular-content-on-a-page">Targeting particular content on a page</h3>

<p>A <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element allows you to target content you want indexed by search engines. If a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element is present, the system will only collect the content inside the element. Be sure that the content you want indexed is inside of this element. If the element is closed too early, important content will not be indexed. Unless the system finds a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element demarcating where the primary content of the page is to be found, repetitive content such as headers, footers, and sidebars will be picked up by search engines as part of a page’s content.</p>

<p>The element is implemented as a stand-alone tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
Redundant header code and navigation elements, sidebars, etc.
&lt;main&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is your page title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main text of your page
&lt;/main&gt;
Redundant footer code
Various scripts, etc.
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The element can also take the form of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the role of main, though this approach is now outdated:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
Redundant header code and navigation elements, sidebars, etc.
&lt;div role=”main”&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is your page title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main text of your page
&lt;/div&gt;
Redundant footer code
Various scripts, etc.
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned above, if no <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element is present, the entire page will be scraped. This is best reserved for non-HTML file types, though, including PDFs, DOCs, and PPTs.</p>

<p><br />
<a id="rel-canonical"></a></p>
<h2 id="canonical-links">Canonical links</h2>
<h3 id="declare-the-real-url-for-a-page">Declare the ‘real’ URL for a page</h3>

<p>There are two good reasons to declare the URL for a given page: CMS sites can easily become crawler traps, and list views can generate urls that are unhelpful as search results.</p>

<p>A crawler trap occurs when the engine falls into a loop of visiting, opening, and “discovering” pages that seem new, but are modifications on existing URLs. These URLs may have appended parameters such as tags, referring pages, Google Tag Manager tokens, page numbers, etc. Crawler traps tend to occur when your site can generate an infinite number of URLs. The crawler is ultimately unable to determine what constitutes the entirety of a site.
<code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.gov/topic1" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>By using a canonical link, shown above, you tell the crawler this is the real URL for the page despite parameters present in the URL when the page is opened. In the example above, even if a crawler opened the page with a URL like <code>https://example.gov/topic1?sortby=desc</code>, only <code>https://www.example.gov/topic1</code> will be captured by the search engine.</p>

<p>Another important use-case for canonical links is the dynamic list. If the example above is a dynamic list of pages about Topic 1, it’s likely there will be pagination at the bottom of the page. This pagination dynamically separates items into distinct pages and generates urls like: <code>https://example.gov/topic1?page=3</code>. As new items are added to or removed from the list, there’s no guarantee that existing items will remain on a particular page. This behavior may frustrate users when a particular page no longer contains the item they want.</p>

<p>Use a canonical link to limit the search engine to indexing only the first page of the list, which the user can then sort or move through as they choose. The individual items on the list are indexed separately and included in search results.</p>

<p><br />
<a id="robots"></a></p>
<h2 id="robots-meta-tags">Robots meta tags</h2>
<h3 id="exclude-particular-pages-from-indexing-or-exclude-their-links-from-being-followed">Exclude particular pages from indexing, or exclude their links from being followed</h3>

<p>There are individual pages on your websites that do not make good search results. This could be archived event pages, list views such as Recent Blog Posts, etc. Blocking individual pages on the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/robotstxt.html">robots.txt file</a> will be difficult if you don’t have easy access to edit the file Even if edits are easy, it could quickly lead to an unmanageably long <code>robots.txt</code>.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that search engines will pay attention to <code>Disallow</code> directives in <code>robots.txt</code> when crawling, but may not when accessing your URLs from other sources, like links from other sites or your sitemap. <strong>Search.gov will rely on robots meta tags when working off your sitemap to know what content you want searchable, and what you don’t want searchable.</strong></p>

<p>To achieve best results for blocking indexing of particular pages, you’ll want to employ meta robots tags in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the pages you want to exclude from the search index.</p>

<p>This example says not to index the page, but allows following the links on the page:</p>

<p><code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>This example says to index the page, but not follow any of the links on the page:</p>

<p><code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="nofollow" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>This example tells bots not to index the page, and not to follow any of the links on the page:</p>

<p><code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>You can also add an X-Robots-Tag to you HTTP header response to control indexing for a given page. This requires deeper access to servers than our customers usually have themselves, so if you are interested in learning more, you can do so <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_meta_tag">here</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>If you have content that should be indexed when it’s fresh, but needs to be removed from the index once it’s outdated, you’ll want to take a few actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once the page’s window of relevance is over, add a <code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex" /&gt;</code> tag to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the page.</li>
  <li>Make sure the modified_time on the page is updated.</li>
  <li>Leave the item in the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/sitemaps.html">sitemap</a>, so that search engines will see the page was updated, revisit it, and see that the item should be removed from the index.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<a id="sample"></a></p>
<h2 id="sample-code-structure">Sample code structure</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#list1">Dynamic list 1: Topic landing page</a></li>
  <li><a href="#list2">Dynamic list 2: Posts tagged XYZ page</a></li>
  <li><a href="#past-event">Event from last month</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="list1"></a></p>
<h3 id="dynamic-list-1-topic-landing-page">Dynamic list 1: Topic landing page</h3>

<p>The following code sample is for a dynamically generated list of pages on your site, where you want the landing page for the list to appear in search results.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Unique title of the page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name="description" content="Some multi-sentence description of various things a person will find on this page. This is a great place to use different terms for the same thing, which is hopefully both plain language and keyword stuffing at the same time." /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:title" content="Unique title of the page" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="Some multi-sentence description of various things a person will find on this page. This is a great place to use different terms for the same thing, which is hopefully both plain language and keyword stuffing at the same time. This could be the same or slightly different than the regular meta description." /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”article:published_time” content=”2018-09-28” /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”article:modified_time” content=”2018-09-28” /&gt;
&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.gov/topic1" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
Redundant header code and navigation elements, sidebars, etc.
&lt;main&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Unique title of the page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the introductory text of the page. It tells people what they’ll find here, why the topic is important, etc. This text is within the main element, and so it will be used to retrieve this page in searches.
&lt;/main&gt;
Dynamically generated list of relevant pages
Pagination
Redundant footer code
Various scripts, etc.
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a id="list2"></a></p>
<h3 id="dynamic-list-2-posts-tagged-xyz">Dynamic list 2: Posts tagged XYZ</h3>

<p>The following code sample is for a dynamically generated list of pages on your site, where you do not want the list to appear in search results. In the case of pages tagged with a particular term, the pages themselves would be good search results, but the list of them would be just another click between the user and the content.</p>

<p>Note: the description tags are still present in case someone links to this page in another system and that system wants to display a summary with the link.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Unique title of the page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="description" content="Some multi-sentence description of various things a person will find on this page. This is a great place to use different terms for the same thing, which is hopefully both plain language and keyword stuffing at the same time. Recommended max characters is 175." /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:title" content="Unique title of the page" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="Some multi-sentence description of various things a person will find on this page. This is a great place to use different terms for the same thing, which is hopefully both plain language and keyword stuffing at the same time. Recommended max characters is 175. This could be the same or slightly different than the regular meta description." /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”article:published_time” content=”2018-09-28” /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”article:modified_time” content=”2018-09-28” /&gt;
&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.gov/posts-tagged-xyz" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
Redundant header code and navigation elements, sidebars, etc.
&lt;h1&gt;Unique title of the page&lt;/h1&gt;
Dynamically generated list of relevant pages
Pagination
Redundant footer code
Various scripts, etc.
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a id="past-event"></a></p>
<h3 id="event-from-last-month">Event from last month</h3>

<p>In the following example, an event page was published in June, and then updated the day after the event occurred. This update adds the <code>meta robots</code> tag, which declares the page should not be indexed, and links from the page should not be followed in future crawls. Again, the meta descriptions are retained in case of linking from other systems.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Unique title of the page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="description" content="Some multi-sentence description of various things a person will find on this page. This is a great place to use different terms for the same thing, which is hopefully both plain language and keyword stuffing at the same time. Recommended max characters is 175." /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:title" content="Unique title of the page" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="Some multi-sentence description of various things a person will find on this page. This is a great place to use different terms for the same thing, which is hopefully both plain language and keyword stuffing at the same time. Recommended max characters is 175. This could be the same or slightly different than the regular meta description." /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”article:published_time” content=”2018-06-04” /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”article:modified_time” content=”2018-08-13” /&gt;
&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.gov/events/august-12-title-of-event" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
Redundant header code and navigation elements, sidebars, etc.
&lt;main&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Unique title of the page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the introductory text of the page. It tells people what they’ll find here, why the topic is important, etc. This text is within the main element, and so it will be used to retrieve this page in searches.
Specifics about the event.
&lt;/main&gt;
Redundant footer code
Various scripts, etc.
&lt;/body&gt;

    <id>https://search.gov/manual/go-live.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your pre-launch checklist will be unique to your agency’s workflow, requirements, and deadlines. Below is a typical checklist.</p>

<h2 id="double-check-your-content-settings">Double Check Your Content Settings</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>1. Have you told us which domain(s) you want to search?</strong> List one or more <a href="https://search.gov/manual/domains.html">domains</a> that you want to search on the first page of web results. Some agencies opt to leave out the ‘www’ to include all subdomains (for example, list usa.gov to include answers.usa.gov, blog.usa.gov, publications.usa.gov, etc). Some agencies especially department-level portals opt to also include their bureaus’ websites (for example, Commerce.gov includes commerce.gov, noaa.gov, trade.gov, etc.)</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>2. Have we indexed your your content?</strong> We follow search engine optimization (SEO) best practices and leverage your <a href="https://search.gov/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a> to monitor for new content. Verify also that you have a <a href="https://search.gov/blog/robotstxt.html">robots.txt file</a>. These two files are typically located in the root directory of your website (i.e., <code>exampleagency.gov/robots.txt</code> and <code>exampleagency.gov/sitemap.xml</code>, respectively). Also verify that your robots.txt file allows our user agent (<code>usasearch</code>) to access your public content.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>3. Have you told us about your RSS feeds?</strong> We love <a href="https://search.gov/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>. Tell us about all of your feeds, even if you opt not to show them (see #5 below). They’re a quick way for us to index your new and updated content, in addition to the content listed on your sitemap (see above). (Tip: Preview your feeds from the RSS page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> to confirm that we’ve indexed your content.)</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>4. Have you told us about your social media accounts?</strong> <a href="https://search.gov/manual/flickr.html">Flickr photostreams</a>, <a href="https://search.gov/manual/twitter.html">tweets</a>, and <a href="https://search.gov/manual/youtube.html">YouTube videos</a> are a great way to highlight your recent content and offer a single point of access to your various publishing channels.</p>

<h2 id="customize-the-display-of-your-search-results-page">Customize the Display of Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>5. Have you made the search results page look like your website?</strong> Customize the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/brand.html">brand</a> (font, colors, logo, favicon, and navigation links) of your search results page to create a seamless experience for users as they search and browse your website.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>6. Have you told us what to show on your results page?</strong> Turn on (or off) the inline modules and facets that you want to appear on your search results page. You can change the default settings on the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page in the Admin Center.</p>

<h2 id="connect-your-site-to-searchgov">Connect Your Site to Search.gov</h2>

<p>Most agencies add these two <a href="https://search.gov/manual/code.html">snippets of code</a> to the template(s) in their websites or content management systems (rather than adding them to individual pages).</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>7. Does your search box point to Search.gov?</strong> Update your search box form code point to our service so that, when users execute a search, they’ll see your Search.gov-hosted results page.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;&lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	 &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
 	&lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
 	&lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
 	&lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>8. Do you have our Javascript tag on your webpages?</strong> This Javascript powers the suggestions for type-ahead and <a href="https://search.gov/manual/display-overview.html">related searches</a>. It also provides data on your trending URLs on the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
	 var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };
 	var script = document.createElement("script");
 	script.type = "text/javascript";
 	script.src = "//search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
 	document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="set-up-nice-to-have-features-optional">Set Up Nice-to-Have Features (Optional)</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>9. Have you masked your domain?</strong> We offer <a href="https://search.gov/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>, which allows you to show searchers search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). If you leverage DNS masking you will have to change your search box form action from search.usa.gov to search.YOURSITE.gov. Be sure to alert us you will be adding a domain mask, so we can add you to our SSL certificate before you update your search box form code.</p>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>10. Have you added the Javascripts for your other third-party web services to your results page?</strong> If you have a <a href="https://search.gov/manual/third-party.html">third-party service</a> running on your website, you likely want it to run on your results page. Agencies often include their Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, or WebTrends code, among others. If your federal website participates in the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a>, you do not need to take any action: DAP code is included on your results page, by default.</p>

<h2 id="dont-forget-seo">Don’t Forget SEO</h2>

<p><i class="icon-check"></i> <strong>11. Have you registered your site with the major commercial search engines?</strong> Register for both <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en">Google Webmaster Tools</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to maximize the coverage of your content in their search results.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>As the U.S. government’s official web portal, <a href="https://www.usa.gov/">USA.gov</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> searches across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. Most government websites end in .gov or .mil, but many end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains.</p>

<p>In support of USA.gov and <a href="https://policy.cio.gov/web-policy/">M-17-06 - Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, Search.gov maintains a list of all government domains that don’t end in .gov or .mil.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-update-the-list">How to Update the List</h2>

<p>Federal agencies <a href="https://policy.cio.gov/web-policy/domain/">are required</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to submit to Search.gov all non-.gov websites for inclusion in the list. This includes subdomains of a second-level domain managed by a third party, and federally controlled subfolders of a domain managed by a third party.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls">list of federal non-.gov domains</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>
    <ul>
      <li>You can also search for specific domains using the search box at the top of the page.</li>
      <li>Quasi-governmental entities are <a href="https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/blob/master/8_govt_urls_quasigovernmental_only.csv">listed here</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To submit updates, you can <a href="https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/issues">open an issue in GitHub</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, or <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email them to Search.gov</a>, such as notice of decommissioned sites, or updates to existing domains. Any new sites <a href="https://policy.cio.gov/web-policy/domain/">must use a .gov or .mil domain</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>After integrating directly with the new USAJOBS API, we worked on additional tuning of trigger words to avoid false positive job-related searches</li>
  <li>We have improved search performance by caching repeat queries made to our data store</li>
  <li>We updated our content parser to accept some non-standard HTML tags, and to ignore any content within <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes-upgrades-misc">Fixes, Upgrades, Misc</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We upgraded Ruby on our <code>search-gov</code> repo</li>

    <id>https://search.gov/releases/december-2018.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We integrated with Bing v7 and transitioned our customers to this newer version.</li>
  <li>We now will index content on a domain even if the root of that domain lists a different domain as the canonical domain. For example, <code>https://publications.sampleagency.gov</code> may list <code>https://www.sampleagency.gov</code> as the canonical domain, but still serve content from <code>https://publications.sampleagency.gov/reports/first_report.pdf</code>. We can now index https://publications.sampleagency.gov/reports/first_report.pdf`.</li>
  <li>We updated our job search location feature to show more job openings, and cleaned up how we send job queries to the USAJOBS api to get more results.</li>
  <li>We now automatically review URLs for reindexing, checking for 404s and 301s. We’re doing this every 30 days to begin with, and will adjust that timeframe as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We upgraded the Ruby version on the repo for our search.gov website, and <code>asis</code>, our image indexing repo.</li>
  <li>We upgraded the <code>activejob</code> Ruby gem across repos.</li>

<ul>
  <li>We integrated directly with the new USAJOBS API. This means that we
    <ul>
      <li>are now querying their system at query time, rather than building an index of their job postings within our own system and querying that at query time.</li>
      <li>have reconfigured what information our jobs searches include in the full query that we send to USAJOBS</li>
      <li>have increased the geographic radius we’ll look at when a user searches on a jobs-related term. The radius is now 75 miles from the user’s general location.</li>
      <li>we are now always providing a link to USAJOBS.gov if someone has searched for a jobs-related term, even if there are no jobs located near the searcher.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We now support indexing TXT files. There are more TXT files on government websites than you would have thought!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We fixed a link in the Jobs module that led searchers to a broken USAJOBS.gov page.</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Mask Your Domain]]></title>
    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/cname.html"/>
    <updated>2018-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/cname.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We offer DNS masking, which allows you to show searchers search.YOURAGENCY.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). Follow these steps to mask your domain. Please note that due to limitations in the size of our SSL certificate, we are only able to offer top level domain masking: i.e., <code>search.youragency.gov</code> but not <code>search.subagency.youragency.gov</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a <code>search</code> subdomain for your domain. If <code>search</code> is already in use in your environment, you could use <code>find</code> or <code>findit</code> as your subdomain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a CNAME in your external DNS records for <code>search.youragency.gov</code>. Point it to <code>yoursitehandle.sites.infr.search.usa.gov</code>. Your site handle is listed on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">settings page</a> in the Search Admin Center.</p>

    <p>For example: if your site handle is <code>abc</code>, the DNS record would look like this:</p>

    <pre><code> search.youragency.gov   CNAME  abc.sites.infr.search.usa.gov
</code></pre>

    <p>NOTE: if your site handle contains a <code>.</code>, please replace it with a <code>-</code> in your DNS record,  e.g., for site handle <code>abc.gov.search</code> the DNS record would look like this:</p>

    <pre><code> search.youragency.gov   CNAME  abc-gov-search.sites.infr.search.usa.gov
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After your DNS record has been added, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> to request to be added to our SSL certificate. If your CNAME is not on our SSL certificate, browser security warnings will appear when your search results page attemps to load over <code>HTTPS</code>. It generally takes a few days for these requests to get through our queue.<br /><br />Your domain mask will work as soon as these two steps are complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your DNS record is in place and you have received confirmation that your domain mask has been added to our SSL certificate, change your search box’s <a href="/manual/code.html">form code</a> action from <code>search.usa.gov/search</code> to <code>search.youragency.gov/search</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Many agencies have both internal and external DNS. Be
sure to update your <em>external</em> DNS records (step 1) before changing your form code (step 2).</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Any search site within your domain may use the same domain mask and CNAME record, even if the CNAME is not associated with that particular site’s handle. To implement an existing mask for a search box, just do Step 2, above.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Once the CNAME is set up, if visitors to your site happen to truncate the URL in the browser bar to http://search.youragency.gov (without any parameters), they’re automatically redirected to your agency’s homepage at http://www.youragency.gov.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Most of our customers use a <code>search.youragency.gov</code> mask (such as search.nih.gov). If the <code>search</code> subdomain is already used by another application, you can use <code>find</code> or <code>findit</code>, such as <code>find.irs.gov</code> or <code>findit.state.gov</code>. We no longer support other subdomain patterns.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We continue to make good progress towards our indexing system, and continues to be highly focused on the back end of our system. See below for more details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We created back-end interfaces allowing the Search.gov team to manage indexed domains &amp; urls.</li>
  <li>We added a delay method to <code>SearchGov Domain</code>, to honor the crawl delay settings in a given site’s <code>robots.txt</code> file.</li>
  <li>We created a <code>SearchGov Domain Indexer</code> job that will enqueue urls in need of fetching, to allow bulk indexing tasks to be automated without overloading anyone’s servers, and we added support for <code>resque-scheduler</code> to our configuration baseline.</li>
  <li>We set the sitemap indexer to reject urls from other domains to avoid erroneous attempts to index content from beta sites, old domains, etc.</li>
  <li>We now check the protocol of a domain, and whether the site is responding to us. We also set our url fetcher to throw an error if the domain is unavailable or blocking our indexer.</li>
  <li>We re-indexed the searchgov indices.</li>
  <li>We upgraded mySQL in demo environments, and streamlined the scenario data for our test suite.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We fixed bug that sent searchers back to page 1 results when changing the time scope in a Collection search.</li>
  <li>We mitigated SSL certificate problems with some sites.</li>
  <li>We made our redirection check more strict to avoid filling our database and indexes with domains and web pages that don’t need to be searchable.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; Best Bets: Text or Graphics</p>

<p>Do you want to promote a specific page or resource? <a href="#best-bets-text">Create a Text Best Bet</a>.</p>

<p>Do you want to promote a set of pages or resources? We recommend you <a href="#best-bets-graphics">create a Graphics Best Bet</a> if you have more than two recommendations on a given topic.</p>

<p>Best Bets appear at the top of the results page when a searcher’s query matches the text of its title, description, or keywords.</p>

<h2 id="best-bets-text">Best Bets: Text</h2>

<p>Text best bets have the same look as standard web results. They’re listed under the heading, Recommended by YourSite.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a text best bet displayed on TSA.gov for a search on <em><a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?query=razors&amp;affiliate=tsa.gov">razors</a></em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/best-bets-text.png" alt="Text best bets for 'razors' on TSA.gov" /></p>

<h3 id="add-an-individual-text-best-bet">Add an Individual Text Best Bet</h3>

<p><strong><em>URL.</em></strong> Add the URL of the web page that you want to promote. Make sure the URL is properly formatted, and includes the protocol (either <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>).</p>

<p><strong><em>Title and Description.</em></strong> Add the title and description of the web page that you want to promote. Each field can have up to 255 characters. Titles and descriptions are visible to searchers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Status and Publish Dates.</em></strong> By default, newly created Best Bets are Active. If you don’t want your Best Bet to display, set it to Inactive. The default start date is the day on which you create the best bet. The default end date is null, so it will stay up forever until you decide to take it down. You can opt to specify other start and end dates using the date pickers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Match Keywords Only?</em></strong> You have the option of having your Best Bets display only for exact keyword matches, and not for title or discription matches. If you select this option, be sure to include <em>all</em> query terms you want the Best Bet to display for, including terms you have used in the title and description.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keywords.</em></strong> Keywords are optional and they’re <em>not</em> visible to searchers. Add specific words or phrases that aren’t already included in the visible title or description. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, plural variations, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field. Use your search Analytics to inform your keyword lists. Keywords are not case sensitive, but are exact matches.</p>

<h3 id="add-multiple-best-bets-via-bulk-upload">Add Multiple Best Bets via Bulk Upload</h3>

<p>You can upload a batch of Text Best Bets, up to 390 at a time. Create a comma-separated file with the following fields (in this order). Download our <a href="/files/best-bets-template-201603.csv">sample template for uploading best bets</a> [CSV] to see the correct format.</p>

<p>Title, URL, Description, StartDate, EndDate, Keywords, Match_Keywords_Only, Status</p>

<ul>
  <li>Required fields:
    <ul>
      <li>Title</li>
      <li>URL. Make sure the URL is properly formatted, and includes the protocol (either <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>).</li>
      <li>Description</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Optional fields:
    <ul>
      <li>Start date</li>
      <li>End date</li>
      <li>Keywords</li>
      <li>Match_Keywords_Only. Enter a <code>1</code> in this column if you want the Best Bet to respond only to the query terms and phrases you’ve specified in this column. Note that selecting this option means you need to list <em>all</em> terms or phrases you want the Best Bet to respond to.</li>
      <li>Status. If you leave this column blank, the Best Bet will default to <code>Active</code> and will display to users. Enter <code>0</code> to set the Best Bet to <code>Inactive</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Save the file with a .csv extension and upload it.</p>

<p>Bulk upload updates existing Best Bets (matching on the URL field) and adds new Best Bets. To turn off Best Bets, either use the <code>Remove</code> button in the Admin Center Best Bets list view, or set the Best Bet to <code>Inactive</code> in the edit view.</p>

<h2 id="best-bets-graphics">Best Bets: Graphics</h2>

<p>Recommended items are displayed in two columns, and you have the option of including an image. We show the most relevant Graphics Best Bet for the query, with the heading, Recommended by YourSite.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a graphics best bet displayed on <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usgs&amp;query=tsunamis">USGS.gov for a search on tsunamis</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usgs&amp;query=tsunamis"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/best-bets-graphics.png" alt="Graphics best bet highlighting tsunami links on USGS.gov" title="Graphics best bet highlighting tsunami links on USGS.gov" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Two columns with a collection of links and an image</strong> displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em><a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=wildfires">wildfires</a></em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Two columns with a collection of links only</strong> displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em><a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=housing">housing</a></em>.</li>
  <li><strong>A single link to a specific web page and an image</strong> displayed on WhiteHouse.gov for a search on <em><a href="https://search.whitehouse.gov/search?affiliate=wh&amp;query=jobs">jobs</a></em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="add-a-graphics-best-bet">Add a Graphics Best Bet</h3>

<p><strong><em>Title.</em></strong> Add the title (up to 255 characters) of the web page or collection of web pages that you want to promote. The title is visible to searchers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Title URL.</em></strong> Add the URL of the primary web page that you want to promote. This field is optional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Status and Publish Dates.</em></strong> By default, newly created Best Bets are Active. If you don’t want your Best Bet to display, set it to Inactive. The default start date is the day on which you create the best bet. The default end date is null, so it will stay up forever until you decide to take it down. You can opt to specify other start and end dates using the date pickers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Image.</em></strong> You can opt to add an image. The file should be a GIF, JPG or PNG with a maximum size of 512 KB. The system will resize your image to fit.</p>

<p><strong><em>Match Keywords Only?</em></strong> You have the option of having your Best Bets display only for exact keyword matches, and not for title and link title matches. If you select this option, be sure to include <em>all</em> query terms you want the Best Bet to display for, including terms you have used in the title and description.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keywords.</em></strong> Keywords are optional and they’re <em>not</em> visible to searchers. Add specific words or phrases that aren’t already included in the visible title or link titles. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, plural variations, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field. Use your search Analytics to inform your keyword lists. Keywords are not case sensitive, but are exact matches.</p>

<p><strong><em>Links.</em></strong> Enter a title and URL for each link. There is no limit on the number of links. Use the list icons (“hamburger buttons”) on the left to rearrange the display order of the links. The two columns populate by rows, so if you have three links, you would have two links in the top row, and one link in the left column of the second row. The link titles are visible to searchers.</p>

<h2 id="when-searchers-see-your-best-bets-graphics">When Searchers See Your Best Bets: Graphics</h2>

<p>For searchers to see a best bet on your site, it must match their query and be relevant and active.</p>

<h3 id="it-matches-their-query">It Matches Their Query</h3>

<p>Searchers see your best bets when their query:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Matches any or all words in the title, description, or link titles, or</li>
  <li>Matches a keyword exactly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Matches are made within, but not across, fields.</p>

<p>A sample graphics best bet entry is below.</p>

<pre><code>Title: Estate Tax  
Link title 1: Transfer Property After You Pass Away  
Link title 2: Estate Tax Rights  
Link title 3: Tax Rates  
Keyword 1: death tax  
Keyword 2: inheritance tax  
Keyword 3: fair market value  
Keyword 4: market value  
</code></pre>

<p>This best bet would display for searches on estate tax (exact title match), estate (partial title match), tax on the estate (title match that includes stopwords), estate taxes (title match for singular/plural variant), property tax (partial link title match), propertey tax (link title match with a slight misspelling), and death tax (exact keyword match), among other queries.</p>

<p>It would <em>not</em> display for searches on death, death property, taxes after death, fair value, as keywords matches must be exact, and these queries are only partial keyword matches. It also would <em>not</em> display for estate property tax, as this is a partial match across multiple fields.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-very-relevant">It Is Very Relevant</h3>

<p>After we determine which best bets match the searcher’s query, we rank their relevance and display only the most relevant. We’ll display up to two text best bets, and up to one graphics best bet. Default relevance is determined first by title, then by description (text best bets) or link titles (graphics best bets), and lastly by keywords. Date is used as a tiebreaker if the entries’ scores based on the above three factors are equal. We display the newer Best Bet.</p>

<p>If you’ve selected Match Keywords Only, then only keywords are used to determine relevance.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-active">It Is Active</h3>

<p>We use <a href="/manual/color-codes.html">color coding</a> to indicate each entry’s status.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Color</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Green   </td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Active         </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Yellow</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Inactive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"> </td>
      <td style="text-align: left"> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Active best bets are shown to searchers on your site. Inactive entries aren’t shown to searchers because they’re inactive, expired (by the publish end date), or both.</p>

<p>Watch the recording of our February 2015 webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzQocKYK0t4"><strong>Straight to the Top: Best Bets in DigitalGov Search</strong></a> (55 mins)</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Use the <a href="/manual/system-alert.html">Search Page Alert</a> feature to add a text message to your search results page, which will appear at all times above all search results, <em>regardless of the query</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Analyze the number of impressions and clicks and clickthru rate for each best bet on the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page. Use the data to inform your titles, descriptions, and keywords and your decision to deactivate or delete an entry.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> When you use the <a href="/manual/collections.html#sitelimit">sitelimit parameter</a> to scope the search to a subsection of your website, we’ll apply this sitelimit to your Best Bets so searchers see recommended pages from within that folder or subdomain only.</p>

<h3 id="weve-received-your-feedback-and-have-it-on-our-radar"><em>We’ve received your feedback and have it on our radar</em></h3>

<h3 id="administration">Administration</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple user types</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>It would be nice to have different levels of account access for users - admin, editorial control (like best bets), report viewer, etc. It would be nice to give some people access to metrics, but not let them make any changes. I can also see the need for some people to make changes to best bets, but not change things like the look and feel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Analytics visualization push/publishing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow customers to push or otherwise publish a visualization of their search data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Downloadable reports in each analytics section (queries, clicks, referrers)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This idea came from a user who liked the weekly query reports found at the bottom of the monthly reports section, but could not use them because her team uses a different start/end date to a week. Downloadable reports in each section would solve this issue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Historical drill down metrics</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Please show drill down metrics for more than the current month. I’d like to be able to see changes from month to month.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Search terms report emailed in middle of day</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I receive the Daily Snapshot by email, which is a nice service. I was thinking, it could also be handy to have a mid-day report generated, too. For example, yesterday was Columbus Day. My employer was open for business as usual. The DigitalGov Search report indicates that “columbus day” was a top search term, and the holiday information pages were top requests. Had I known at noon that people had searched for “columbus day” in the morning, then I could have posted in the afternoon on social media information about Columbus Day hours and such. A midday search report could help us be more proactive in assisting our website visitors and the population at large.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Separate columns for numbered lists on analytics reports</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>On the Queries report (and any other numbered list) screen, please remove the numbers from the cell containing the value. Instead, include in a first, separate column. The only way for us to export data currently is to manually copy / paste into Excel. To do any additional analysis, we need to remove the numbers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sortable columns on the Queries page</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Add sortable columns to the Queries page so you can change the sort order by any of the four columns.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Search team note: if we implement this feature, we’d also implement the change in the Queries and Referrers sections.</em></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add ability to use domain url as a variable or token</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Using this approach, a modification to the domain url can be changed in one field instead of having to change it throughout every setting in the site config.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Allow sites to hide the filters bar</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I would like to remove the menu bar with the Everything (All Time and Best Match drop downs) filter.</li>
      <li><em>Search team note: the filter feature only appears when results are being served from our indexes</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Allow a user to query (GET) a document ID via API</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow a user to query (GET) a document ID in the DigitalGov Search ID, so they can see if it already exists and what current values are for its fields. Currently, the contents the of documents are not transparent, not returned even in the response of a successful POST/PUT, so there is no way to verify that inputs were formatted and saved correctly. This makes it difficult to debug an issue that doesn’t cause an API error response (like putting a value in the wrong field, but still submitting a valid JSON document).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Batch Upload of Routed Query data</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Bulk upload of Routed Query data similar to the Text Best Bets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Collection with file types filtered</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I would like to create a collection where I can also specify what file types will show up - PDF, html, doc, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Display more job listings</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Let sites show more jobs search results</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Display video results in a grid</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Download current Best Bets</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I would like to be able to download or print in a friendly format the Best Bets list. Our staff contributes to the recommended links. I have a master Excel sheet, but I’d like to be able to grab a version of everything that is logged in. The current format does not print well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphics Best Bets image should be clickable</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Graphics Best Bets should have an optional description</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow Graphics Best Bets to have an optional description. Our site doesn’t have a central page for a certain topic, so  search becomes the central place for that topic. I also think it would be a value add to have a description field because then users can skip going to an extra page if they find what they need right on the search page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Integrate the USA.gov directory information for each agency into search results</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I think it would be beneficial to people who search for an agency name to get the corresponding directory record information from USA.gov. There is a directory API available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Logo file types</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Add SVG as an allowable logo file type.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Search Page Alert improvements</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow links to be added to the Search Page Alert.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tweets tab</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Could there be a separate tab/link (like Images) for Twitter that would show all Twitter feeds by order of tweet?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Type-ahead suggestions can be added in Admin Center</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I heard that it’s possible to add typeahead suggestions manually in the back end. Can we do this through the Admin Center?</li>
      <li><em>Search team note: Currently, your agency can email us if there are typeahead suggestions you’d like to appear for your search configuration.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="what-is-i14y">What is i14y?</h2>

<p>The Search.gov i14y Content Indexing API allows you to send content directly from your content management system (CMS) into Search.gov for real-time indexing. By hooking into your CMS workflow, you can immediately create, update, and delete the associated documents in our search indexes via this API. Even if you don’t have a CMS, you can develop software to publish your content in a way that meets the i14y API specifications below.</p>

<p>Ruby/Python/Node clients are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you Begin</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Set-up a search site with our service via 
<a href="https://search.gov">Search.gov</a></li>
  <li>Request that your search site be enabled for i14y by <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">emailing our team</a>.</li>
  <li>Set up an i14y “drawer” in our system. <a href="https://search.gov/manual/i14y-drawers.html">Full instructions</a> are available in our help manual. You’ll give your drawer a handle, and you’ll need to enter this drawer handle in the username field below after you click the Authorize button.</li>
  <li>Get your i14y secret token. You’ll need to enter this token as your password.
The token can be found in our system in: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers, select the option Show.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-i14y">What is i14y?</h2>

<p>i14y is a content indexing API that allows you to send your content directly to our indexes. When your site is enabled for i14y, it gives you complete control over what searchers see. No commercial web results will be served: instead, searchers will see content exactly as you’ve sent it to us.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-i14y">How Do I Use i14y?</h2>

<p>We currently have a <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> that will hook your CMS into i14y. You can also check out our <a href="/manual/drupal.html">help docs for working with the Drupal module</a>.</p>

<p>If you use a different CMS, or don’t have one at all, we recommend you focus on publishing a comprehensive <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">xml sitemap</a>, which we would leverage to index your content.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> i14y does not visit your content to do full-text scraping of your content. For new implementations, the Search.gov team recommends you index your content with us not using the i14y API, but rather by publishing a comprehensive xml sitemap, which we can use to index your content. <a href="/blog/six-months-in.html">Read more.</a></p>

<h2 id="checklist-to-go-live-with-i14y">Checklist to Go Live with i14y</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-connect-one-of-your-sites-to-i14y">Step 1. Connect one of your sites to i14y</h3>

<p>i14y needs to be enabled in the back end for a site to be able to receive content through it. You can</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/manual/add-site.html">Add a brand new search site</a>,</li>
  <li>Use the Clone Site tool to copy one of your existing site’s settings to a new site (<code>YourSite &gt; Dashboard &gt; Clone Site</code>), or</li>
  <li>use an existing site.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Email us</a> and let us know which site you want enabled for i14y. Please note: once we turn on i14y for a site, we no longer serve search results from a commercial web index. Therefore, we recommend that you set up a test site for i14y, so that your customers will continue to get results until you are fully set up and ready to move your i14y index to your production search site.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-add-a-drawer">Step 2. Add a Drawer</h3>

<p>An i14y Drawer is an index receiving content via the i14y API. We’ve called them <strong>Drawers</strong> because, like drawers in a filing cabinet, multiple indexes can be included in a single configuration to scope the entirety of a site’s search.</p>

<p>After we have enabled i14y for your search site, a new page will appear: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers.</p>

<p>Click <code>Add i14y Drawer</code> in the upper right corner. Create a handle for your drawer - the handle must be all lowercase alphanumeric, all one word, and can include underscores but no other special characters (e.g., agency_drawer_handle2).</p>

<p>The Drawer <em>Description</em> is optional.</p>

<p>If you have more than one website or domain that will be sending content, add a separate Drawer for each of these sites. We also recommend setting up separate drawers for staging or test content, so you can easily remove that content from your search site when you are ready to go live.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-fill-your-drawer">Step 3. Fill your Drawer</h3>

<p>After you have created your Drawer(s), click <code>Show</code> from the i14y Drawers list to find that Drawer’s secret API key. Use this secret key with your drawer handle in your API call or your CMS module to send your content to the right place.</p>

<p>You are now ready to add content to your drawer. You can do this in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use i14y directly. View our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/i14y">Github repo</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> or <a href="/developer/indexing-api.html">Technical Documentation</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Use a module plugged into your CMS. At this time there is a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> available. Help docs for the module are <a href="/manual/drupal.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Important Note:</strong> i14y does not visit your content to do full-text scraping of your content. For new implementations, the Search.gov team recommends you index your content with us not using the i14y API, but rather by publishing a comprehensive xml sitemap, which we can use to index your content. <a href="/blog/six-months-in.html">Read more.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-4-review-your-index">Step 4. Review your index</h3>

<p>You can view the number of documents indexed for each drawer on the main i14y Drawers list, and when the most recent document was received. Click <code>Show</code> to view documents within a particular drawer. We display the most recent 1,000 items that were sent to the drawer. You can also search for keywords in the documents’ text, titles, and descriptions (Note: you cannot currently search for URLs).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We use the <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> section to scope search results - if the domain(s) of your i14y content are not listed in the Domains section, that content will not appear on your search results page.</p>

<p>We send success and / or failure codes in response to your API call, so if the number of documents in our index doesn’t match what you sent, check those response codes.</p>

<p>If you experience difficulty sending documents to i14y, it is possible your firewall is not letting you communicate with the i14y server. Check out our <a href="/developer/i14y-testing.html">cURL test commands</a> or view the full <a href="/developer/indexing-api.html">i14y documentation</a>.</p>

<p>We can attach each i14y drawer to multiple search configurations: if you have a drawer that you’d like to use for multiple search sites, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Caution:</em></strong> A pop-up message will appear when you hit <code>Remove</code> on a drawer: please review this pop-up message carefully. If you remove a drawer that is only associated with one search configuration, the drawer and its contents will be deleted from our system. If the drawer is attached to multiple search configurations, it will only be removed from the search configuration you are currently on. The pop-up message will indicate what type of drawer you have.</p>

<p>If you accidentally delete a drawer, you will need to set-up a new drawer and resend the content - we are unable to retrieve deleted drawers. If you accidentally remove a shared drawer but it is still associated with other search configurations, we can re-attach it to your site. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Contact us</a> for assistance.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-configure-your-search">Step 5. Configure your search</h3>

<p>Once you have your index populated, you will <a href="/manual/content-overview.html">set up the rest of your search</a> as you would for a traditional Search.gov site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set your default search scope on your <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page. Use the <a href="/manual/filter-tags.html">Filter Tags</a> feature to further scope your search results.</li>
  <li>Add social media accounts: <a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a>, <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a>, and <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a></li>
  <li>Create <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a> and <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets</a></li>
  <li>Select your display settings (both <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">search features</a> and <a href="/manual/brand.html">branding</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS content</a> that will not be sent to your i14y drawer, you can add those feeds as well.</p>

<h3 id="step-6-update-your-search-box">Step 6. Update your search box</h3>

<p>Update your website’s search box <a href="/manual/code.html">form code</a> to point to <code>affiliate=youri14yenabledsitehandle</code>.</p>

<h3 id="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</h3>

<p>By accessing the i14y API, you agree to <a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/terms-of-service.shtml">USA.gov’s Terms of Service for Developer Resources</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> i14y is hacker shorthand for “interoperability”, because there are 14 characters between the first and last letters. i14y can also be shorthand for Independence Day.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you experience difficulty sending documents to our index via <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a>, it is possible your firewall is not letting you communicate with the i14y server. Adding a test document to your i14y drawer can help you diagnose a firewall issue.
Windows users may need to <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html">install cURL</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> in order to run this test from the command line.</p>

<h2 id="adding-the-test-document">Adding the Test Document</h2>

<p>From the command line, enter:</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents" -XPOST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -u your_drawer_handle:your_secret_token -d '{"document_id":"1", "title":"Test Document", "path": "http://www.gov.gov/cms/doc1.html", "created": "2015-05-12T22:35:09Z", "description":"The summary of the document goes here.", "content":"This is placeholder text, and in a real document would be paragraphs long.", "promote": false, "language" : "en", "tags" : "tag1, another tag"}'
</code></pre>

<p>Note: you need to replace <strong>your_drawer_handle</strong> with your i14y drawer handle, found in the i14y drawers section in the Search Admin Center (<a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers). You will also need to replace <strong>your_secret_token</strong> with the drawer’s secret token, which can be found by hitting “Show” in the 14y drawer list. The drawer handle and token should be separated by a colon (:) with no spaces on either side of the colon.</p>

<p>The above command returns JSON structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
"status":200,
"developer_message":"OK",
"user_message":"Your document was successfully created."
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not see a 200 status, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact our team</a>.</p>

<p>After successfully sending a document, you should see an increase (by 1) in the number of documents in your <a href="/manual/i14y-drawers.html">i14y drawer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="removing-the-test-document">Removing the Test Document</h2>

<p>Once you have successfully added the test document to your drawer, you will need to delete it, or it will appear in your site’s search results.</p>

<p>From the command line, enter:</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents/1" -XDELETE -u your_drawer_handle:your_secret_token
</code></pre>

<p>The above command returns JSON structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
"status":200,
"developer_message":"OK",
"user_message":"Your document was successfully deleted."
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use the Search.gov service on a Drupal-based website, you should install the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap">XML Sitemap</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> module, and may want to consider a tool like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/yoast_seo">Yoast SEO</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to pull in non-Drupal content as well. You may also be interested in our overview of <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>usasearch</code> <a href="https://drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> can facilitate indexing content with our service, but we prefer the XML sitemap method.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is possible to manually modify the Drupal search box to connect to our service, but the module allows you to make the connection via a setting configuration, rather than code work.</li>

<h3 id="do-you-have-the-right-module-for-your-drupal-version">Do you have the right module for your Drupal version?</h3>

<p>We have modules for both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8. If your site is in Drupal 7, use <code>usasearch-7.x-5.7</code>. If your site is in Drupal 8, click <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch/releases">View all Releases</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and select API version <code>8.x</code>.</p>

<h3 id="have-you-set-up-an-i14y-drawer">Have you set up an i14y drawer?</h3>

<p>In order to send content from Drupal to our system, you’ll need an index to send the content into. We call these indexes “Drawers”, because like drawers in a filing cabinet, all the items put into them will be the content you can search against. <a href="/manual/i14y-drawers.html">Read more about Drawers here</a>. In order to set up a drawer, your search site will need to be enabled for i14y, so <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact us</a> to request that.</p>

<h3 id="has-any-content-actually-been-sent-to-us">Has any content actually been sent to us?</h3>

<p>The module sends content when someone hits <code>save</code> on a node, or when you run <code>re-index site</code>. In Drupal 7, <code>re-index site</code> is found on the main Drupal search settings page (<code>YOUR-DRUPAL-SITE.gov/admin/config/search/settings</code>); in Drupal 8, you can re-index the site from the bottom of the module settings page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If these actions have indeed happened, check the Drupal recent log messages (<code>YOUR-DRUPAL-SITE.gov/admin/reports/dblog</code>) to see if there’s anything related to <code>usasearch</code>, and please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">send us screenshots of the errors</a>.</li>
  <li>If these actions haven’t yet happened, please hit <code>save</code> on a node, and see if that item appears in your Drawer. You can view the contents of your Drawer by selecting <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> &gt; Your site &gt; Content &gt; i14y Drawers &gt; Show. If the item isn’t there, then check the Drupal log for an error.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="is-your-firewall-letting-you-communicate-with-us">Is your firewall letting you communicate with us?</h3>

<p>If content isn’t reaching us, it could be that your firewall is not allowing you to reach i14y. Please run the following from the command line, from inside the same firewall as your web server, if possible. Note: you’ll need to customize the string below with your i14y drawer’s handle and secret token (where it says <code>YOURDRAWERHANDLE:YOURDRAWERSECRETTOKEN</code>):</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents" -XPOST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -u YOURDRAWERHANDLE:YOURDRAWERSECRETTOKEN -d '{"document_id":"1", "title":"test item", "created":"2017-02-16T10:19:02", "path":"https://www.usa.gov", "description":"This is a test", "content":"This is a test to see if the agency web server is able to communicate with the i14y API. If this document does not show up in the drawer in the admin center, then the i14y location may need to be whitelisted in order to facilitate indexing."}'
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you get a <code>403 Forbidden</code> response</p>

    <p>Please contact your security team to request the i14y hostname be whitelisted: <code>https://i14y.usa.gov/</code></p>

    <p>We can’t give you an IP to whitelist, as our system is hosted in AWS, and so i14y’s IP address changes regularly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you get a <code>200 OK</code> response</p>

    <p>Your system is able to communicate with our system, so the issue must lie in how the module is working with your Drupal instance. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Send us</a> all the information and screenshots of errors that you can, and we’ll help you troubleshoot.</p>

    <p>Be sure you delete the test document or it will be included in your search results. You can delete it from the command line. Run this command:</p>

    <pre><code>curl "https://i14y.usa.gov/api/v1/documents/1" -XDELETE -u YOURDRAWERHANDLE:YOURDRAWERSECRETTOKEN
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you get any other error response</p>

    <p>Please take a screenshot and <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">send it to us</a> to report the issue so we can investigate the error.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="do-you-have-another-question">Do you have another question?</h3>

<p>If you have another question about indexing with our service through the <code>usasearch</code> Drupal module, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">don’t hesitate to ask</a>!</p>

<p><a name="search-errors"></a></p>

<h2 id="search-errors">Search errors</h2>

<h3 id="is-your-drupal-site-search-box-showing-drupal-search-results">Is your Drupal site search box showing Drupal search results?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a <strong>Drupal 7</strong> site</p>

    <p>Our Drupal 7 module is designed to take over the native Drupal search box on your site, and direct queries to the site you specify in the <code>affiliate site handle</code> field. If you’re seeing other results - either the Drupal search results or a different search site in our system, find out if the search box form code had been manually modified to point to this other location. Our module will only work with out-of-the-box Drupal search boxes. If the search box form code was modified, you’ll need to manually point it to our service using the required parameters - you can see <a href="/manual/code.html">general information on form code here</a>, or you can view examples customized to your particular site within the Admin Center, under <code>Activate</code>. You may also be able to restore the form code to the Drupal default, to take advantage of the module’s site handle field and be able to modify the site handle without a dev.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a <strong>Drupal 8</strong> site</p>

    <p>In Drupal 8, we don’t override the native Drupal search box. Instead, you need to place a <code>USA Search Form</code> block, and disable the default Drupal search. To do this, go to <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-SITE.gov/admin/structure/block</code> in your Drupal site, and do <code>ctrl-F</code> to locate the word <code>Search</code> in the list. Disable the block that says just <code>Search</code>. Use <code>Place block</code> to insert a <code>USA Search Form</code> block in the block region of your choice. The search box in this block will point at the search site you entered in the module settings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="is-the-drupal-site-search-box-directing-to-the-wrong-searchgov-site">Is the Drupal site search box directing to the wrong Search.gov site?</h3>

<p>Your search box should use the site handle you entered on the module settings page. If you run a search and are brought to our search results page, but see the wrong search site, check to see if the Drupal search box form code was manually modified to point to another search site handle (the <code>affiliate</code> parameter in the form code). If it was modified, you’ll need to change the site handle directly in that modified code. You may also be able to restore the form code to the Drupal default, to take advantage of the module’s site handle field and be able to modify the site handle without a developer.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-another-question-1">Do you have another question?</h3>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/drupal-8-module-instructions.html"/>
    <updated>2018-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/drupal-8-module-instructions.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> April, 2018. For new implementations, the Search.gov team recommends you index your content with us not using our Drupal module to send content to our i14y indexing API, but rather by publishing a comprehensive XML sitemap, which we can use to index your content. We recommend the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap">XML Sitemap module</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. <a href="/blog/six-months-in.html">Read more.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This documentation will walk you through setting up the <code>usasearch</code> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch/releases?api_version%5B%5D=7234">Drupal 8 module</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> field by field, to integrate your Drupal CMS with the Search.gov service. If you have trouble, take a look at our <a href="/manual/drupal-module-troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting tips</a>.</p>

<p>These instructions follow the order of settings listed in our Drupal module at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/config/search/usasearch</code>.</p>

<p>Instructions for setting up the <strong>Drupal 7</strong> module are <a href="/manual/drupal-7-module-instructions.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="search-settings">Search Settings</h2>

<p>This section allows you to configure how the <code>USA Search Block</code> will use our service. In Drupal 8, you must place the <code>USA Search Block</code>, as we do not override the native Drupal Search. We recommend you disable the native Drupal Search block.</p>

<h3 id="site-handle">Site handle</h3>

<p>Required. Enter the site handle you gave your search site. This is found in our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> &gt; Your site &gt; Dashboard &gt; Settings.</p>

<h3 id="enable-autocomplete">Enable autocomplete</h3>

<p>Recommended setting: Checked.</p>

<p>Check this box if you want to enable the Javascript for our <a href="/developer/">Type-ahead API</a>. Suggestions for popular queries will appear below your search box as searchers begin typing. A query must have been run more than 10 times in a day for it to become a search suggestion.</p>

<h3 id="search-domain">Search domain</h3>

<p>We offer <a href="/manual/cname.html">domain masking</a>, which allows you to display <code>search.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> in the URL of your search results page, instead of the default <code>search.usa.gov</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Only change this setting if you have domain masking configured for your search site! If you haven’t set it up, leave the default <code>https://search.usa.gov</code> until you’ve completed the masking steps.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-drupal-to-our-system-for-direct-indexing">Connecting Drupal to Our System for Direct Indexing</h2>

<p>Highly recommended! The “i14y API settings” section allows you to send content directly to our indexes via our i14y API. This means that you’ll have full control over the content of your search results, and your search index will be updated in real time. Note: If you do not want to index your content with us yourselves, do not complete this section. If you only want to use our system for search, skip this section and the following Indexing section.</p>

<h3 id="enable-i14y-api">Enable i14y API</h3>

<p>Recommended! If this box is checked, the module will send content to Search.gov for indexing. The <code>Drawer Handle</code> and <code>API Secret Token</code> fields will be required.</p>

<h3 id="drawer-handle">Drawer Handle</h3>

<p>Enter your i14y  “drawer handle”. This is the name you gave your drawer and is found in: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> &gt; Your site &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers.</p>

<h3 id="i14y-api-secret-token">i14y API Secret Token</h3>

<p>Enter your i14y drawer’s “secret token”. This can be found in our system in: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Search Admin Center</a> &gt; Your site &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers, select the option, <code>Show</code>.</p>

<h3 id="content-types">Content Types</h3>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Checked - all types.</p>

<p>Select which content types will be sent to our indexes. Content types unchecked here will <strong>not</strong> be indexed. You can also control indexing status of individual nodes in their Search.gov settings.</p>

<p>If you exclude a content type from indexing, and later decide to <em>include</em> it, nodes of this type will be indexed on the next cron run. You may also want to review any nodes that were created in the interim, to ensure in their individual Search.gov settings that they are enabled for indexing.</p>

<h3 id="description-view-mode">Description View Mode</h3>

<p>Recommended setting: Teaser.</p>

<p>Select the search result description text that works best for your site. Choose among the text you’ve set as your teaser, RSS item content, Drupal search index snippet, or full text. The view mode  will need to be enabled and configured for each content type. If the view mode is not available for a content type, “Teaser” will be used. The full text of your node will still be searchable.</p>

<p>Note: If you don’t like the content that’s being sent to us as the Teaser, you can make changes for that content type’s at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE] &gt; Display settings</code> or
<code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE]/display/teaser</code></p>

<h3 id="enable-i14y-logging">Enable i14y logging</h3>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Checked.</p>

<p>Check this box to log i14y API operations to the watchdog log. On <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-8-SITE.gov/admin/reports/dblog</code>, filter by Type <code>usasearch</code>.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-indexing-domain">Alternate indexing domain</h3>

<p>Do you edit your site on one domain or subdomain, but publish on another? If so, use this field to set the domain you want us to present for your content on the search results page. For instance, if you enter <code>www.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> here, nodes that are stored in Drupal under <code>edit.YOURAGENCY.gov</code> would be indexed with us as <code>www.YOURAGENCY.gov</code>.</p>

<h2 id="indexing">Indexing</h2>

<h3 id="re-index-site">Re-index site</h3>

<p>If you click <code>re-index site</code>, we will begin a full-site reindexing on your next cron run. You can wait for cron to run, or you can run it manually.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-items-to-index-per-cron-run">Number of items to index per cron run</h3>

<p>Use this throttle to adjust the number of documents sent to us in each cron run. The number that is best for your site will depend on various factors, including your firewall.</p>

<h2 id="save-configuration">Save configuration</h2>

<p>After you save these settings, the module will send a command to us when you hit <code>Save</code> on a node in Drupal, either to add the node to the index, update it, or delete it from the index.</p>

<h2 id="having-trouble">Having trouble?</h2>

<p>Take a look at our <a href="/manual/drupal-module-troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting tips</a>, and don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">reach out</a>. We’re not Drupal experts ourselves, but we’ll try to help.</p>

<h2 id="use-rules-to-index-content">Use rules to index content</h2>

<p>Check this box to index content manually with rules. IMPORTANT: If checked, the Search.gov index will not be updated unless specified in a rule action.</p>

<p>Be sure to write rules for your content types in sets of three:</p>
<ul>
  <li>adding to the index</li>
  <li>updating the index</li>
  <li>deleting from the index</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results-description-view-mode">Results Description View Mode</h2>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Teaser.</p>

<p>Select the search result description text that works best for your site. Choose among the text you’ve set as your teaser, RSS item content, Drupal search index snippet, or full text. The view mode will need to be enabled and configured for each content type. If the view mode is not available for a content type, “Teaser” will be used. We will still index and search the full text of your content if <code>Indexed content view mode</code> is <code>Full content</code>.</p>

<p>Note: If you don’t like the content that’s being sent to us as the Teaser, you can make changes for that content type’s at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE] &gt; Display settings</code> or at <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/[CONTENT TYPE]/display/teaser</code>.</p>

<p>Recommended setting (default): Checked.</p>

<p>Check this box to include entire content types in the search index. Include or exclude particular content types in their entirety in the Search.gov settings for the content type’s structure page, e.g. <code>YOUR-DRUPAL-7-SITE.gov/admin/structure/types/manage/article</code>. You can exclude individual nodes using the Search.gov Settings within the node edit view.</p>

<p>If this box is unchecked, node indexing will need to be managed individually. We recommend you leave the box checked on the module settings.</p>

<p>If you exclude a content type from indexing, and later decide to <em>include</em> it, nodes of this type will be indexed on the next cron run. You may also want to review any nodes that were created in the interim, to ensure in their individual Search.gov settings that they are enabled for indexing.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Six Months In&#58; Lessons Learned in the Transition to Search.gov]]></title>
    <link href="https://search.gov/blog/six-months-in.html"/>
    <updated>2018-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/six-months-in.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In September 2017 <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">we announced</a> that we would be moving away from using commercial search engines as our primary source of web results. This was driven by Google’s announcement that they would be sunsetting their Site Search API at the end of March 2018, and our desire to have more control over the quality, coverage, and cost of our web results than we were able to achieve with Bing.</p>

<p>We’d like to update you on our progress and share some lessons learned. Over the past months we’ve worked with many of you and listened to the challenges you face in your particular environments. In the fall we believed that encouraging agencies towards using our i14y indexing API was the best way to go. Having lived into it, we now know that we need to focus on indexing content directly off of your websites, leveraging structured lists of URLs known as XML sitemaps. The lessons here are presented in the order we learned them, and we’ve updated the <a href="/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html">indexing FAQs</a> to reflect the current approach.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<h3 id="1-the-api-first-focus-we-began-with-isnt-viable-as-a-standard-solution">1. The API-first focus we began with isn’t viable as a standard solution</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Many agencies use content management systems for which we are unable to provide an integration, and struggle to create one on their own.</li>
  <li>Even though many agencies use Drupal, and may have been able to leverage our module, distributed site management and quarantine-like firewalling make it highly difficult to get i14y indexing up and running via the module.</li>
  <li>Mixed platforms for content mean that most sites will need other indexing support beyond just i14y.</li>
  <li>The number of indexes created by our API model isn’t scalable. Even though Elasticsearch, the search solution our system is built on, is designed for its indexes to expand to great size with ease, it doesn’t perform well with a high number of relatively small indexes.</li>
  <li>And finally, many agencies still have static sites, from which it’s close to impossible to export even a clean list of URLs for indexing, much less to push content out to an API over time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-crawling-is-prohibitively-resource-intense">2. Crawling is prohibitively resource-intense</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To assist some static sites in our early-transition group, we incorporated a crawler into our stack, to facilitate content discover in those websites. The crawler does a good job, but it’s still a manual process and automating for continuous discovery would require significant processing power.</li>
  <li>Crawl delays, as set in robots.txt files, have a serious impact on indexing speed. At a crawl delay of 10, it would take over two weeks to crawl a site of 150,000 pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-relevancy-ranking-is-easiest-to-manage-if-all-the-content-is-in-the-same-index">3. Relevancy ranking is easiest to manage if all the content is in the same index</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In addition to search indexes holding data from pages and files, it can also have indicator data showing how a given piece of content should be ranked relative to other pieces of content. For sites who have sent web content into i14y drawer indexes and have content that we have indexed from static files, each index will have ranking indicators, but it’s hard for a search system to know how to compare the different indicators when blending results together.</li>
  <li>We’ll be able to add more ranking indicators to the index that we build than we can offer in the i14y drawer indexes built by agencies via API.</li>
  <li>If an agency is able to send 100% of the content they want searched, with full text, to a single i14y drawer, then their relevance ranking would be easy to determine. While most agencies can’t do this, we will continue to support i14y for the agencies that have already launched with it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-xml-sitemaps-are-great---really-helpful-for-search-engines-and-pretty-easy-for-agencies-to-implement">4. XML sitemaps are great - really helpful for search engines and pretty easy for agencies to implement</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An XML sitemap is a machine-friendly list of the contents of a website. While no one can know for sure, the consensus in the SEO industry is that Google and Bing use XML sitemaps as part of their monitoring sites for new or updated content. Making it easy for them to find your content is thought to give a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/seo/site-architecture-search-engine-ranking">ranking boost to your site’s content</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>Most content management systems have plugins that will generate an xml sitemap for the content in the CMS. Static content can either be added to the CMS-generated sitemap, or listed in a separate sitemap file.</li>
  <li>We feel it’s a better use of time for agency teams to work on implementing good sitemaps that will help them out in Google and Bing, as well as with the Search.gov system, than to invest a lot of time in an integration that only works with us.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-where-are-we-now">So where are we now?</h2>

<p>We built the new index model and released that in December 2017, along with our core indexing job that grabs data from pages - html, pdf, and the other major file types.</p>

<p>We added a crawler in January 2018, to facilitate URL discovery on a given website.</p>

<p>We added the ability to index content from XML sitemaps in February. We follow the <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">sitemaps protocol</a>  <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, which relies in part on also having  and have posted a explainer pages about <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a> and <a href="/blog/robotstxt.html">robots.txt files</a> to get you the most essential information.</p>

<p>We removed our connection to the Google Site Search API in March, and are now serving results from our own index for those cases where we had previously used Google.</p>

<p>We started with a small representative set of sites, and have moved into working on our highest traffic customers. Over 90 search sites now bear the <code>Powered by Search.gov</code> mark on their search results pages, including <a href="https://search.ssa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=ssa&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=replacement+card">SSA.gov</a>, <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=tsa.gov&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=screening">TSA.gov</a>, <a href="https://search.medicare.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=medicaregov&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=medical+equipment">Medicare.gov</a>, and many more.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-next">Where to next?</h2>

<p>Unlike with the Google API sunset, there is no hard deadline for our moving sites off Bing and into our own index. Our timelines around Bing are driving toward having well over half of our search traffic going to our own indexes this fiscal year. We’ll continue to work on high traffic sites, large Department website searches, and the many agency component websites that combine to create the parent website’s search.</p>

<p>If your search site is low traffic and you haven’t heard from us yet, you can expect to remain on Bing for the foreseeable future. We will reach out as the time draws near.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we encourage <em>all</em> sites to invest some time in developing and maintaining a good XML sitemap. As mentioned above, this will help us maintain a good index of your content, and it will also give you a Google boost, so it’s really win-win. Part of having a good sitemap is having a good robots.txt file as well. Read over our new explainer posts and reach out with any questions.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Search.gov&#58; Index Transition FAQs]]></title>
    <link href="https://search.gov/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html"/>
    <updated>2018-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Updated March 2018</em></p>

<p>In FY18, we changed our name to Search.gov, and are transitioning from leveraging commercial engines for search results to serving results from our own indexes.</p>

<p>We’re now developing our own search indexes from your site content. We will primarily be leveraging <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a> to discover your content (1st option, preferred). We’ll also accept content for real-time indexing via <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a> (2nd option).</p>

<p>Other search features and your search results page will remain the same, and searchers should not notice a difference.</p>

<p>We’ll work closely with you to make sure everything goes smoothly through the transition. Please view our <a href="/blog/six-months-in.html">recent status post</a> to learn more about the progress we’ve made, and you can <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">read the original announcement</a> as well.</p>

<p>We will update these FAQs with questions we hear from our customers.</p>

<h1 id="general-1">General</h1>

<h2 id="q-what-do-i-need-to-do-in-this-new-model">Q: What do I need to do in this new model?</h2>

<p>We’ll work with you to get a good XML sitemap in place for your content, or set of sitemaps, as fits your use case. Sites using content management systems that are able to sent <em>all</em> content into an i14y drawer may investigate integrating with i14y. If you’re unable to do either of these things, we’ll want to discuss options with you.  See the indexing questions below for more information.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-is-the-timeline-for-the-transition">Q: What is the timeline for the transition?</h2>

<p>We launched the first phase of the new index in December 2017. We’ve reached the deadline Google had set for sunsetting their Site Search API, and are now disconnected from that service and supporting those searches from our own indexes. We continue to reach out to sites as we focus on indexing their content. We don’t have a hard deadline for getting everyone moved over, and are prioritizing high traffic search sites first for moving into our indexes. Over 90 search sites are already supported from our indexes.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-do-i-need-to-do-today">Q: What do I need to do today?</h2>

<p><em>CMS customers:</em></p>

<p>We encourage you to set-up and implement <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a> as soon as possible. Most content management systems have plugins that will facilitate creation of these sitemaps. Please also review your <a href="/blog/robotstxt.html">robots.txt file</a> to ensure the sitemaps are listed there, and that all the content you want searchable is allowed to be indexed.</p>

<p><em>Non-CMS Customers:</em></p>

<p>We encourage you to explore how you can publish an <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemap</a>. Please also review your <a href="/blog/robotstxt.html">robots.txt file</a> to ensure the sitemaps are listed there, and that all the content you want searchable is allowed to be indexed.</p>

<h2 id="q-do-i-need-to-change-any-code-on-my-website">Q: Do I need to change any code on my website?</h2>

<p>No: you do not need to update any code on your website. Indexing takes place in the backend of our system.</p>

<p>We do ask that you publish <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">XML sitemaps</a>, and update your <a href="/blog/robotstxt.html">robots.txt file</a>.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-was-my-site-getting-results-before">Q: How was my site getting results before?</h2>

<p>Since 2007, we served search results from Bing’s index by default. We also used Google’s index to support certain Collections where Bing does not provide results. We’re now serving these results from our own indexes, and are disconnected from Google.</p>

<h2 id="q-why-did-you-change-your-name">Q: Why did you change your name?</h2>

<p>We changed our name to make things simpler. In the past, we’ve been FirstGov Search, FirstSearch, USAGov Search, USASearch, and most recently DigitalGov Search. Our new name is short, simple, and easy to remember.</p>

<h1 id="indexing-1">Indexing</h1>

<h2 id="q-how-will-you-index-my-site">Q: How will you index my site?</h2>

<p>Based on your site setup, you have a variety of options. Below is our order of preference in terms of how we’ll get your content into our indexes (note: you may choose more than one approach):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">Structured URL list (XML sitemap)</a> – We will fetch and index the URLs that you provide on an XML sitemap, and will monitor your sitemaps for new content and updates over time. Our system will visit the URLs you provide and extract page titles, dates, and full text for indexing. You can post multiple sitemaps for content from different platforms - <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">get the essential information about sitemaps here</a>. This is the preferred method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/i14y.html">i14y API</a> –  Our API allows you to update your search index in real-time. Best for agencies with dedicated developer resources and single-platform publishing environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/rss.html">RSS feed</a> – We will still accept RSS feeds to update your indexes on a rolling basis.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re unable to do any of the above, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact us</a>, and we’ll discuss options.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-often-will-you-update-my-index">Q: How often will you update my index?</h2>

<p>If you have an XML sitemap, our default will be to monitor it daily for newly published or updated pages. If you have a need to have certain content searchable within minutes of publication, please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">let us know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-will-you-remove-items-from-the-index">Q: How will you remove items from the index?</h2>

<p>We will be monitoring the status of pages in our index. If any start returning a <code>404 Not Found</code>, <code>403 Not Permitted</code>, <code>301 Permanent Redirect</code>, or other non-<code>200 OK</code> response, we will remove those items from the index. For redirects, we’ll update the index with information from the target page.</p>

<p>Removing a page from the sitemap will not remove it from the search index. If the page is still publicly accessible and returning a <code>200</code> response, you can <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact us</a> to have it removed from the index, or you can use our <a href="/manual/filter-content.html">Filter URLs</a> feature to suppress the item from appearing in search results.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-does-the-sitemap-control-my-search-results">Q: How does the sitemap control my search results?</h2>

<p>It doesn’t! Sitemaps advertise to search engines what content is on a site that should be searchable. The Search.gov engine then brings that content into our index. Separately, the settings you manage in the Admin Center dictate how we should pull results from our index when people search for things on your site.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-if-i-already-use-i14y-or-rss-to-send-content">Q: What if I already use i14y or RSS to send content?</h2>

<p>If you have set up i14y already, or if you send your full site content via RSS, you do not have to change anything for the new model.</p>

<h2 id="q-i-use-drupal-is-there-a-module-i-could-leverage">Q: I use Drupal, is there a module I could leverage?</h2>

<p>Yes! For customers who use Drupal as their CMS, please install the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap">XML Sitemaps module</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a> that can jumpstart a connection with the i14y indexing API. This module is available for both Drupal 7 and 8, but we’ve found that the module only supports about half of the Drupal publishing models in government.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-if-i-have-content-in-my-cms-plus-files-stored-on-filesystems-such-as-pdfs">Q: What if I have content in my CMS plus files stored on filesystems (such as PDFs)?</h2>

<p>If your site is in a CMS but you also have published material outside of the CMS (such as PDFs or old web pages), we’ll be able to search both CMS and non-CMS content together.</p>

<p>You will need to publish an XML sitemap of your non-CMS material, or you could manually add the content to your CMS-managed sitemap(s). <em>Note:</em> PDFs count as non-CMS content even if they’re attached within your CMS.</p>

<h2 id="q-are-there-cms-sitemap-plugins-available-other-than-drupal">Q: Are there CMS sitemap plugins available, other than Drupal?</h2>

<p>Yes - see our <a href="/blog/sitemaps.html">XML Sitemaps overview page</a> for a more complete list of tools.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-if-we-have-no-plans-for-a-cms">Q: What if we have no plans for a CMS?</h2>

<p>You can still create an XML sitemap, though you may need to update it manually, or develop a regular server job to keep it updated.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-can-i-create-or-find-a-list-of-urls-for-my-site-to-build-a-sitemap">Q: How can I create or find a list of URLs for my site, to build a sitemap?</h2>

<p>You should be able to run a command to export all of the URLs on your webserver, such as <code>ls</code> or <code>grep</code> or <code>dir</code>. Consult your friendly neighborhood server admin for assistance.</p>

<p>Some sites have XML sitemaps that list URLs and files. Your sitemap may be incomplete, so you’ll want to review it.</p>

<p>We call several different indexes when serving search results, and we present results from each of these indexes in a separate module. Each module loads when there are relevant search results to display.

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/queries.html"/>
    <updated>2018-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/queries.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Analytics &gt; Queries</p>

<p>The Queries page lists the number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box on your site by a unique searcher.</p>

<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site’s visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<p>Data are available in the Admin Center from the past 13 months.</p>

<h2 id="top-queries">Top Queries</h2>

<p><strong><em>Top 1,000.</em></strong> You’ll see a list, in frequency order, of the 1,000 most popular queries for your selected time period.</p>

<p><strong><em>Top 1,000 by query.</em></strong> Enter any specific term or phrase into the Query search box. Re-generate the report to see the top 1,000 queries that contain that term or phrase and its stemmed equivalents.</p>

<p>For example, below are the top 10 queries related to <em>housing</em> on USA.gov in August 2013.</p>

<ol>
  <li>house of representatives</li>
  <li>housing</li>
  <li>speaker of the house</li>
  <li>white house</li>
  <li>house minority leader</li>
  <li>housing assistance</li>
  <li>house majority leader</li>
  <li>speaker of the house 2013</li>
  <li>the white house</li>
  <li>houses</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="download-details">Download Details</h2>

<p>You can download a detailed CSV (comma separated values) file for any search term. There’s one line for each time this query was run. This CSV file gives you access to the raw search logs, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date and time of the query</li>
  <li>The query (It is embedded in the request URL. Look for the text following ‘query=’.)</li>
  <li>Where the person was when they ran the search (We use the ISO-2 alpha standard for country codes and ISO 3166-2 codes for country subdivisions.)</li>
  <li>The modules loaded in response to the query (Our <a href="/manual/module-codes.html">Module Codes</a> page provides a key of the codes and names.)</li>
  <li>The kind of device and browser they were using</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="clicks-from-a-query-and-queries-leading-to-a-click">Clicks from a Query and Queries Leading to a Click</h2>

<p>Select “View Clicks” to view the top clicked URLs for each query.</p>

<p>If you clicked on “View Clicks” for the <em>house of representatives</em> example above, you’d see that the top URLs clicked for that query are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>www.house.gov</li>
  <li>www.house.gov/representatives</li>
  <li>www.house.gov/representatives/find</li>
</ol>

<p>From this list of clicked URLs, you’d be able to select “View Queries” to view the top queries that led to a click for each URL.</p>

<p>If you clicked on the first-listed <em>www.house.gov</em> in the example above, you’d see that the top queries leading to a click on that URL are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>house of representatives</li>
  <li>congress</li>
  <li>congress members</li>
  <li>congress representatives</li>
</ol>

<p>You can loop through or drill down into this list for any set of clicks and queries.</p>

<h2 id="click-through-rate-ctr">Click-Through Rate (CTR)</h2>

<p>The click-through rate (CTR) is the the number of clicks from a query divided by the number of queries (multiplied by 100 to be expressed as a percentage).</p>

<p>High or low CTR’s may indicate that users are not able to find relevant results. A CTR can be over 100%: if a user enters a query, clicks on a link, hits ‘back’ in their browser, returns to the search results, and clicks again, the CTR for that query would be 200% (2 clicks divided by 1 query, multiplied by 100 = 200%).</p>

<p>The Clicks page shows what searchers clicked on from your search results pages, and the number of times each of those items was clicked during the selected date range. The current month is shown by default, and the date can be adjusted using the date selectors at the top of the page and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site’s visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<p>Data are available in the Admin Center from the past 13 months.</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/releases/january-2018.html"/>
    <updated>2018-02-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/january-2018.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">new indexing system</a> has been in production since December! In January, we released several features that are building on and improving our new system:
    <ul>
      <li>We updated our index with new stemming settings. Stemming refers to how a system processes related words, based on the root of the words. For example, stemming is what allows a search for “renew passport” to show results for “passport renewal”.</li>
      <li>URLs in our index can be permanently deleted from our system.</li>
      <li>Documents in our index are now limited to 10 MB in size.</li>
      <li>We can extract body text from a document if the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element is empty.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We upgraded Rails and Elasticsearch on our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/asis">ASIS application</a>.</li>
  <li>We upgraded Elasticsearch on our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs API</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Instagram section is no longer displayed in the Admin Center dashboard, unless you had an Instagram account added to your search site prior to June 2016. At that time, Instagram began requiring accounts to grant permission to index their images via an integration between systems, which Search.gov cannot support. Therefore, our Instagram index was last updated in June 2016. Any images in our index prior to that date will continue to be shown on your search results page, as long as you do not remove your Instagram account from the Admin Center. If you remove your account, any photos in our index will be permanently deleted from our system.</li>
  <li>Drilldown tables and graphs are no longer available in the Monthly Reports section. According to our analytics, the tables and graphs were not being viewed. We anticipate rolling out new analytics viewing options later in 2018.</li>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/routed-queries.html"/>
    <updated>2018-02-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/routed-queries.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; Routed Queries</p>

<p>Do you want to get searchers to a specific web page as quickly as possible? Create a Routed Query.</p>

<p>A routed query skips the search results page and automatically directs visitors to a web page of your choice for very specific queries. Use query routing to save visitors the extra step of reading through search results links by taking them directly to your content pages.</p>

<p>We recommend creating a routed query for <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/02/06/top-task-usability-design-for-your-users/">top tasks</a> that have a good content page but less-than-ideal search results.</p>

<h2 id="add-a-routed-query">Add a Routed Query</h2>

<p><strong><em>Routed Query URL.</em></strong> Add the URL of the web page that you want to direct visitors to.</p>

<p><strong><em>Routed Query Description.</em></strong> Add a brief description to help you remember why you created this entry and what it does. Descriptions aren’t used for indexing or visible to searchers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keywords.</em></strong> Add the specific words or phrases used to trigger the routing. Searchers will only be directed to the URL above when their query term exactly matches one of the listed keywords. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: Any keyword that you add to a Routed Query will become a permanent <a href="/manual/typeahead-api.html">type-ahead suggestion</a>. This applies to all 3 ways that type-ahead suggestions are displayed from our system: the module that can be turned on in the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html#modules">Display Overview section</a>, the <a href="/manual/typeahead-api.html">JavaScript snippet</a>, and the <a href="/manual/typeahead-api.html">API</a>. If you do not want certain keywords to appear as type-ahead suggestions, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-how-it-works">Examples of How It Works</h2>

<p>Private industry has been using query routing for some time. If you go to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and search for a general term like <em>carpet</em>, you’re routed to their carpet navigation page. If you search for a more specific term like <em>vanities</em>, you get standard search results.</p>

<p>Using USA.gov an as example, every time someone goes to <a href="https://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and searches for any of the following terms (must be exact matches), they’ll automatically be directed to the USA.gov <a href="https://www.usa.gov/unclaimed-money">Unclaimed Money from the Government</a> page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>missing money</li>
  <li>unclaimed assets</li>
  <li>unclaimed funds</li>
  <li>unclaimed money</li>
  <li>unclaimed money in my name</li>
  <li>unclaimed property</li>
</ul>

<p>If they get routed to the <a href="https://www.usa.gov/unclaimed-money">Unclaimed Money from the Government</a> and search again for one of these terms, they’ll get the standard list of search results. We won’t take people in an endless loop.</p>

<p>If they search for something not on the above list, like <em>show me missing money</em>, they’ll still get the normal search results.</p>

<p>There may be times when you want to add a system alert to your search results page. For instance, during a <a href="/manual/redesign.html">site redesign</a>, you may wish to inform searchers that your site is in transition.</p>

<p>Use the Search Page Alert feature to add a text message to your search results page, which will appear at all times above all search results, <em>regardless of the query</em>. Enter a title and text for the alert, set the status to active, and hit <code>Save</code> to turn on your alert. The appearance of the alert is not customizable.</p>

<p>See, for example, the custom alert on Defense.gov announcing their migration to a new system.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/system-alert.png" alt="Custom System Alert on Defense.gov" title="Custom System Alert on Defense.gov" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> See also our closely related feature <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets</a>, which allows you to recommend individual results or sets of results, which will appear <em>only when a searcher’s query matches</em> the text of their titles, descriptions, or keywords.</p>

<p><strong>ALERT:</strong>  Instagram now requires accounts to grant permission to index their images via an integration between systems. Since this integration will not be possible for Search.gov in the foreseeable future, we’re exploring other options. Our Instagram index was last updated in June 2016. Any images in our index prior to that date will continue to be shown on your search results page, as long as you do not remove your Instagram account from the Admin Center. If you remove your account, any photos in our index will be permanently deleted from our system. This help manual page is for historical reference only.</p>

<h2 id="tell-us-about-your-instagram-account">Tell Us About Your Instagram Account</h2>

<p>Provide us with the <em>username</em> for your Instagram Account.</p>

<p>When you’re logged into Instagram, you can see your username at <a href="https://instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/accounts/edit/">https://instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/accounts/edit/</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>For example, the Instagram username for the Department of Labor is <a href="https://instagram.com/usdol/">usdol</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<h2 id="opt-to-display-your-instagram-pictures">Opt to Display Your Instagram Pictures</h2>

<p>When you add the username for your Instagram account, we’ll automatically index all of the pictures in your account.</p>

<p>On the image results page, we’ll display the pictures from your Instagram account by default. If you’d like to backfill them with the standard image results from your website, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> and we’ll turn on your web images for you.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows image results displayed on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=u.s.departmentoflabor&amp;query=minimum+wage">DOL.gov for a search on <em>minimum wage</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=u.s.departmentoflabor&amp;query=minimum+wage"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/social-media-instagram.png" alt="Image results from Flickr &amp; Instagram" title="Image results from Flickr &amp; Instagram" /></a></p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency’s photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery? You can index <a href="/manual/rss.html">MRSS feeds</a> so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can also tell us about your <a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a> photostream. Note that searchers see interspersed results from both Flickr and Instagram. If you have a lot of duplicate images in the two services, consider listing only one in the Admin Center.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Flickr and Instagram results appear on the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned results page</a> only. Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> if you’re ready to turn on the new results page.</p>

<p>The monthly report gives a bird’s-eye view of the number of <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicks</a> each month.</p>

<p>Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site’s visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<h2 id="monthly-usage-stats">Monthly Usage Stats</h2>

<p>Data for the total number of queries and clicks. Use this report to find and analyze the so-called <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/analysis/long-tail.html">short head</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> of your most popular search queries and clicks, which are typically the same as your site’s <a href="http://www.usability.gov/tags/task-analysis/">top tasks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="queries-with-no-results">Queries with No Results</h3>

<p>A list of queries that returned no results. Sometimes, searchers look for information on the wrong website or use different words than what are used on the page, and so they get no results. Use this list of Queries with No Results to help searchers get to the information they’re looking for. You can set up <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets</a>, or a <a href="/manual/routed-queries.html">Routed Query</a>. You can also <a href="/manual/no-results.html">customize the No Results message</a> displayed on your results page.</p>

<h2 id="impressions-and-clicks-by-module">Impressions and Clicks by Module</h2>

<p>Detailed data for the total number of impressions and clicks and your clickthru rate (CTR) are presented for each “module” on the search results page. We also provide the average CTR across all Search.gov customers so you can see how your rate compares to the average rate. The data in the table is sorted in descending order from the most to least number of clicks.</p>

<p>Use this report to inform which <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">modules you opt to display</a>.</p>

<h2 id="download-top-queries">Download Top Queries</h2>

<p>View a detailed report of the number of times searchers have input specific terms and phrases by clicking on the CSV (comma-separated values) link to download the list as a text file. Once you’ve downloaded the CSV file, you can easily <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-e8ab9ff3-be8d-43f1-9d52-b5e8a008ba5c">import it  into Excel</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> or another speadsheet program to analyze the data.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>All data presented on this page (and other pages in the Admin Center) are IP-deduped to exclude bots and other noise in an attempt to accurately represent searchers’ intent on your site. Some definitions follow.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/queries.html">Queries</a>:</strong> Number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box by a unique searcher.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/manual/clicks.html">Clicks</a>.</strong> Number of times a searcher clicked on one of your pages within the search results for a particular query.</p>

<p><strong>Impressions:</strong> Number of times a module is displayed, whether it is clicked on or not. Not all modules are displayed for all queries. Each time a module is displayed it is counted as one impression.</p>

<p><strong>Clickthru Rate (CTR):</strong> The rate (expressed in a percentage) at which searchers click on a module. This rate is calculated by dividing the total number of clicks by the total number of impressions. CTR is useful to measure the performance of specific campaigns, such as <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets</a> for seasonal events.</p>

<p><strong>Raw count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted. The raw count is provided in the downloadable CSV files only.</p>

<p><strong>IP-deduped count:</strong> Total number of times the query was submitted by any one IP address. This excludes bots and other traffic that send in a query multiple times from one IP address. It is often a more accurate representation of “real,” human traffic.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> On the first of each month, we email you a report with data on the previous month’s queries, clicks, and top search terms.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day or so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">new indexing system</a> is now in production! Our team has been hard at work on this effort since June, and we are thrilled to reach this exciting milestone. In December, we released several features that helped us cross the first phase finish line:
    <ul>
      <li>Our new system is live with an updated version of ElasticSearch.</li>
      <li>Our new system takes into consideration a “Promote” value when determining relevancy. “Promote” is a true/false value and is optional.</li>
      <li>Our technical lead improved the way the Loofah scraper gets HTML documents into our system. We work in the open as much as possible, and this <a href="https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/pull/134">minor change</a> helped fix a large bug in the Loofah core code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The endpoint for our <a href="/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a> was updated on December 7th. This change puts the hostname under Search.gov’s DNS zone; previously, it was hosted in another part of our division. This code change only affected agencies that are directly calling our open source API. If you are only using our Jobs Module on your hosted search results page, you did not need to take any action.</li>
  <li>We updated Rails on our Jobs API.</li>
  <li>We updated Ruby on our main application.</li>
  <li>We transitioned away from using UserVoice to collect feedback from our customers. Instead, you can submit feedback via  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemE9w893BahVqCbDl8vlgsawGPdcXigwovOZIqIQAIMRyOWw/viewform">Google form</a> or by <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">emailing us</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Dashboard &gt; Site Overview</p>

<p>The Site Overview page provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day. All of the analytics in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> are updated in real-time, which means that you instantaneously see the searches and clicks as they’re performed on your site.</p>

<p>You can opt to receive this snapshot as a daily email by clicking on the envelope icon (<i class="icon-envelope"></i>) in the top navigation bar next to your selected site.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site’s visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<h2 id="top-queries">Top Queries</h2>

<p>A list of the 10 most popular searches on your site. If you don’t have any searches, you’ll see a “Not enough query data available” message.</p>

<p>The data are processed to present “real” searches by humans (that is, the data are de-duped by IP address to remove bot traffic and other noise).</p>

<h2 id="top-clicked-urls">Top Clicked URLs</h2>

<p>A list of the top 10 pages that were clicked thru by searchers on your search results page. If you don’t have any clicks, you’ll see a “Not enough query data available” message.</p>

<h2 id="trending-urls">Trending URLs</h2>

<p>A list of the top 10 changing URLs that were <em>visited by users on your website</em>. If there are any pages that are trending, they’ll appear here.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular pages on your website. Investigate why pages are trending, if the reason is not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>You’ll only see the trending URLs list if you have our <a href="/manual/code.html">Javascript snippet</a> on your web pages. Data are updated every few minutes, so you may see URLs come and go quickly.</p>

<h2 id="trending-queries">Trending Queries</h2>

<p>A list of the top 10 search terms with the greatest <em>gain</em> between yesterday and today. If there are any queries that are trending, they’ll appear here.</p>

<p>Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it’s current, accurate, and complete.</p>

<h2 id="queries-with-no-results">Queries with No Results</h2>

<p>A list of the top 10 queries that returned no results.</p>

<p>Use this data to help searchers find your content by adding a <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bet</a>, updating your existing web pages, or both.</p>

<p>For example, on one agency’s website, a dozen searches for <em>frostline</em> returned no results. The frost line—also known as depth of frost or freezing—is the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The agency’s pages on the topic referred to this concept as <em>depth of freezing</em>.</p>

<h2 id="top-queries-with-low-click-thrus">Top Queries with Low Click Thrus</h2>

<p>A list of the top 10 searches with low click thru rates. If there are any frequently searched terms that returned results but didn’t get a click at least 20% of the time, they’ll appear here.</p>

<p>Use this alert about low click thrus to identify issues with coverage. You may opt to create a <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bet</a>, add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Or, you may opt to incorporate language from these popular search terms into your page titles and descriptions, or enter common search terms as keywords, verbatim.</p>

<h2 id="this-months-totals-to-date">This Month’s Totals to Date</h2>

<p>The total number of queries and clicks for the present month-to-date. A click is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link.</p>

<p>A graph of your site’s total search queries over time is also presented to provide an overview of how your traffic has trended from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than the last 13 months). Hover over the trend line to see the total number of queries in a given month.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> The <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Report</a> gives a bird’s-eye view of the number of <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicks</a> each month.</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/releases/november-2017.html"/>
    <updated>2017-12-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/november-2017.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To accomplish our <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">FY 2018 goals</a>, we continued backend development that will allow your agency content to be served directly from our indexes. In November, our team began testing our new system. We also released several features related to this project:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a> results will now come from our indexes. Previously, a site that saw main page search results from our indexes would still see Bing or Google results when using Collections. Now, if a site is using our indexes for its main search page, its Collections results will also come from our indexes.</li>
      <li>The <a href="/manual/rss.html">page-1 RSS module</a> and <a href="/manual/system-alert.html">search page alert</a> will now appear for sites getting results from our indexes. Previously, these two features only worked on sites using Bing/Google.</li>
      <li><a href="/developer/indexing-api.html">i14y documents</a> will be rejected if the<code> document_id</code> contains slashes or is more than 512 bytes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>
<ul>
  <li>On November 14th, we notified our users of a <a href="http://mailchi.mp/support/service-degradation-resolved">Bing service degradation</a>. This caused inconsistent results across sites, including incomplete results or 503 errors, and prevented access to the Search Admin Center. The inconsistency began at 2:05pm ET and ended at 3:05pm ET.</li>
  <li>We continued transitioning our repos to use Circle CI.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Phrase searches now work with content that is served from our indexes. A search for “cheese curds” will return results for the specific phrase “cheese curds” rather than the separate words “cheese” and “curds”.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> &gt; Advanced &gt; Filter Tags</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this feature is only available to sites that are enabled for <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a>.</p>

<p>Tags are used in the full text searching of i14y documents. If a tag is added to a document, the document will appear in search results when a query matches the tag, even if the term does not appear in the document’s full text.</p>

<p>Use the Filter Tags feature to scope your search site based on tags. You can exclude documents that have a given tag from all search results. Or, you can require that a tag is present in order for a document to be shown.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can have a “News Search” site that will only show results that have the tag “news”.</li>
  <li>You can exclude all documents that have the “blog” tag from your search results, if you don’t want them to appear.</li>

    <id>https://search.gov/releases/october-2017.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To accomplish our <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">FY 2018 goals</a>, we continued backend development that will allow your agency content to be sent directly into our indexes. In October, our team completed work that enables our system to process PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We completed our transition to Chef 12.</li>
  <li>We updated our program website to be https://search.gov/. As part of that process, we changed our website favicon to our new logo, updated references to our program on individual pages, and created a new <a href="/manual/cname.html">domain mask</a>.</li>
  <li>We updated the attribution at the bottom of search results pages that display content from our indexes. Those pages now say “Powered by Search.gov.”</li>
  <li>We began transitioning our repos to use Circle CI.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our hosted search results pages are 508 compliant, and we undergo regular review to ensure compliance. This month, we added underlining to the links that are displayed in the headers, footers, and navigation bars on our search results pages. The underlining appears when you hover over the link, and indicates that the links are not regular text.<br />

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to search your news or multimedia content? Would you like them to be able to narrow results by date?</p>

<p>Tell us the locations and names of your RSS feeds. We index all new and updated content on your feeds within minutes.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-tell-us-about-your-rss-feeds">Step 1. Tell Us About Your RSS Feeds</h2>

<p>We love feeds! Tell us about <em>all</em> of your RSS feeds, even if you don’t opt to show them in step 2 below. Feeds are the fastest and most reliable way for us to learn about your new and updated content.</p>

<p>Select the option to add a new RSS feed.</p>

<h3 id="name">Name</h3>

<p>Create a name for the feed. Within this ‘bucket’ you can list a single RSS feed or many feeds. For example, you can opt to list all of your agency’s press releases separately (such as Police News, Fire News, EMS News, etc.) or you can list all three under one general name (such as News).</p>

<h3 id="feed-type">Feed type</h3>

<p>Select the type of feed. The default option is RSS (for text content like press releases or blogs). Change it to <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">media RSS</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> for multimedia content like images and videos.</p>

<p>Each item within a RSS feed must include a title, link, description, and publication date.</p>

<p>Each item within a media RSS feed must also include both a <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-content">media:content URL</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to specify a direct URL to the media object and a <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-thumbnails">media:thumbnail URL</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to specify a URL to the object’s thumbnail.</p>

<p>Any items missing a required element won’t display in your search results.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-opt-to-show-as-a-facet-inline-module-or-both">Step 2. Opt to Show as a Facet, Inline Module, or Both</h2>

<p>Allow searchers to see inline results for recent, relevant RSS results <em>across all of your RSS feeds</em> by turning on the News module on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. When a searcher’s query matches the title of an RSS article published within the past four months, the article appears in the News module. Very recent news results (less than five days) appear at the top of the page and less recent news results appear at the bottom. Up to three articles are displayed. You can edit the default module title, News, on the Display Overview page.</p>

<p>Allow searchers to narrow results to a specific feed by turning on the option to show the facet on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. To ensure searchers don’t encounter too many dead ends, we recommend showing only feeds with a significant amount of content as a facet.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-check-your-search-results-page">Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page</h2>

<h3 id="module">Module</h3>

<p>If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) as a module, searchers will see inline news results. It will highlight the three most recent, relevant results across all of your RSS feeds.</p>

<p><img src="/img/RSS-Inline.png" alt="RSS Inline Module Example" /></p>

<h3 id="facet">Facet</h3>

<p>If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) as a facet, searchers can narrow their results to see only RSS-based content by clicking on the facet.</p>

<p>Within the RSS-based results, searchers can opt to limit results to the last hour, day, week, month, or year, or they can set a custom date range. They also can sort results in descending order by relevance (best match first) or date (most recent first).</p>

<h3 id="results-count">Results count</h3>

<p>We show the number of results returned for searches against your feed(s).</p>

<p><img src="/img/RSS-Facet.png" alt="RSS Facet Example with Results Count" /></p>

<h2 id="step-4-check-the-status-of-your-feeds">Step 4. Check the Status of Your Feeds</h2>

<p>We use <a href="/manual/color-codes.html">color coding</a> to indicate each feed’s status.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/rss-status.png" alt="RSS status messages and colors" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> We index the content on your RSS feeds from the time you input them in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. To backfill historical content, temporarily modify your RSS feeds to return more results. Leave this larger feed in place for one hour. You can do this during off-hours and you don’t need to coordinate with us.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can set up a search box on your website that limits results to your feed.</p>

<p>Start with the standard form snippet on the <a href="/manual/code.html">Code Snippets</a> page under the Activate Search tab. Change the form action to <code>action="https://search.usa.gov/search/news</code> and add the following line to limit the results to your feed.</p>

<p><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;</code></p>

<p>The value is the number for your feed ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your feed in the Admin Center.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can click on the ‘Preview’ option to see the content we have indexed for each of your RSS feeds.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> When you <a href="/manual/youtube.html">provide us with your YouTube channel</a>, we’ll automatically index the RSS feed for your YouTube channel.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> For any feeds that you’ve extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> property, searchers may narrow results by these facets in the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">sidebar</a> on the results page.</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/typeahead-api.html"/>
    <updated>2017-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/typeahead-api.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: this information is for customers who wish to display type-ahead (autocomplete) suggestions on their agency’s website. If you are only looking to turn on type-ahead suggestions on your search results page, please review the instructions on our <a href="/manual/display-overview.html#modules">Display Overview</a> page.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get type-ahead suggestions to appear on your agency’s website.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-snippet">JavaScript Snippet</h2>

<p>We offer a JavaScript snippet that is placed on your pages before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>You must be a Search.gov customer to use this feature. Full instructions and code can be found under <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Activate Search &gt; Code Snippets.</p>

<p>The code will look similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
      var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };

      var script = document.createElement("script");
      script.type = "text/javascript";
      script.src = "//search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
      document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);

//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="type-ahead-api">Type-ahead API</h2>

<p>The Type-ahead API exposes your site’s type-ahead suggestions. Calling the API directly alllows you to show type-ahead suggestions without adding the JavaScript code.</p>

<p>This API is available for use on official government websites only. You must be a Search.gov customer to access the instructions. <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Sign in</a> is required.</p>

<p>Keys and instructions can be found under <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Activate Search &gt; Type-ahead API Instructions.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting:</em></strong> Suggestions are derived from the searches performed on your website. For additional details, please review the Type-ahead API section in the Search <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a>.</p>

  <li>
    <p>We announced the changes coming to our program in FY 2018. Read our <a href="/blog/searchgov-blog.html">blog post</a> and <a href="/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To accomplish our FY 2018 goals, we continued backend development that will allow your agency content to be sent directly into our indexes. In September, our team investigated multiple tools that can fetch website content, parse it, and send it into our Elasticsearch indexes. We also completed work that will ensure our new system follows “noindex” meta tags and headers if they are present on your website.</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/i14y-drawers.html"/>
    <updated>2017-10-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/i14y-drawers.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers</p>

<p>An <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a> Drawer is an index receiving content via the i14y API. We’ve called them <strong>Drawers</strong> because, like drawers in a filing cabinet, multiple indexes can be included in a single configuration to scope the entirety of a site’s search.</p>

<p>Information on working with our Drupal module is <a href="/manual/drupal.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-make-sure-your-site-is-connected-to-i14y">Step 1. Make sure your site is connected to i14y</h2>

<p>If your site Admin Center has the following page: <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers, your site is connected to i14y. If you don’t see this page in the Admin Center, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>. You can also read about <a href="/developer/i14y.html">Getting Started with i14y</a>.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-add-one-or-more-drawers">Step 2. Add one or more Drawers</h2>
<p>On <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; i14y Drawers, Click <code>Add i14y Drawer</code> in the upper right corner. If you have more than one website that will be sending content, add a separate Drawer for each of these sites.</p>

<h3 id="handle">Handle</h3>

<p>Let us know what the handle for your drawer should be - the handle must be all lowercase alphanumeric, all one word, and can include underscores but no other special characters (e.g., agency_drawer_handle2).</p>

<p>The Drawer <em>Description</em> is optional</p>

<h2 id="step-3-send-content-to-fill-your-drawer">Step 3. Send Content to Fill your Drawer</h2>

<p>After you have created your Drawer(s), click <code>Show</code> from the i14y Drawers list to find that Drawer’s secret API key. Use this secret key with your drawer handle in your API call or your CMS module to <a href="/developer/indexing-api.html">send your content to the right place</a>.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-review-your-index">Step 4. Review your Index</h2>

<p>You can view the number of documents indexed for each drawer on the main i14y Drawers list, and when the most recent document was received. Click <code>Show</code> to view documents within a particular drawer. We display the most recent 1,000 items that were sent to the drawer. You can also search for keywords in the documents’ text, titles, and descriptions (Note: you cannot currently search for URLs).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We use the <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> section to scope search results - if the domain(s) of your i14y content are not listed in the Domains section, that content will not appear on your search results page.</p>

<p>We send success and / or failure codes in response to your API call, so if the number of documents in our index doesn’t match what you sent, check those response codes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If you experience difficulty sending documents to i14y, it is possible your firewall is not letting you communicate with the i14y server. Check out our <a href="/developer/i14y-testing.html">cURL test commands</a> or view the full <a href="/developer/indexing-api.html">i14y documentation</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><em>Caution:</em></strong> A pop-up message will appear when you hit <code>Remove</code> on a drawer: please review this pop-up message carefully. If you remove a drawer that is only associated with one search configuration, the drawer and its contents will be deleted from our system. If the drawer is attached to multiple search configurations, it will only be removed from the search configuration you are currently on. The pop-up message will indicate what type of drawer you have.</p>

<p>If you accidentally delete a drawer, you will need to set-up a new drawer and resend the content - we are unable to retrieve deleted drawers. If you accidentally remove a shared drawer but it is still associated with other search configurations, we can re-attach it to your site. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Contact us</a> for assistance.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> We can attach each i14y drawer to multiple search configurations: if you have a drawer that you’d like to use for multiple search sites, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Search.gov -- The Road Ahead in 2018]]></title>
    <link href="https://search.gov/blog/searchgov-blog.html"/>
    <updated>2017-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/searchgov-blog.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce some exciting upcoming changes to our service. On October 1st, we’ll become Search.gov. We’re changing more than just our name; in fiscal year 2018, we will use our own indexes to serve search results instead of relying on <a href="/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html#q-how-was-my-site-getting-results-before">commercial web search engines</a>.</p>

<p>Why are we evolving in this direction? Licensing commercial search results is expensive and complex. As we’ve continued to grow, our costs have continued to increase, and a new model has become a necessity.</p>

<p>Indexing changes will begin rolling out in early FY18 and will only affect where your web results come from. Your search results page will look the same, and our additional search features will also be the same: <a href="https://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets</a>, <a href="https://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/collections.html">Collections</a>, job postings, social media integrations, and so on.</p>

<p>In this new model, we’ll work closely with you to get your sites indexed. This post describes the different approaches we’ll take and what we’ll need from you, depending on which method is right for your site and needs.</p>

<p>We know that one of the core features of our service is how simple it is to get your site search up and running. We’ll always strive to make the service easy to use.</p>

<p>Speaking of easy to use: we’re changing our name to make things simpler. In the past, we’ve been FirstGov Search, FirstSearch, USAGov Search, USASearch, and most recently DigitalGov Search. Our new name is short, simple, and easy to remember.</p>

<h2 id="overview-what-it-means-to-use-our-indexes-instead-of-commercial-web-indexes">Overview: What It Means To Use Our Indexes Instead of Commercial Web Indexes</h2>

<p>Our current default is to serve search results from Bing’s index. Once a query is made, we get a set of results from Bing via API and display them on your search results page. We also use Google’s index to support certain Collections where Bing does not provide results. However, this past spring, Google announced they will be shutting down the API we use for these searches in March 2018. This would leave us with a gap in our service.</p>

<p>To address this gap and other licensing complexities, we will focus on using our own indexes in FY18 instead of getting Bing or Google results. This means that we will need to know what content is on your website, and get information about it into our indexes.</p>

<p>In the most basic terms, here’s what we’ll be doing:</p>

<p><img src="/img/basic-indexing-flow.png" alt="alt text" title="Flowchart showing the major phases of search indexing: Discover, Parse, Index, and Search." /></p>

<p><em><a href="/img/searchgov-flow.png" title="How Search.gov Works">Detailed diagram</a></em></p>

<p>Below are the options for how you can tell us about your site content. The list is divided into sections based on whether or not your website is on a content management system (CMS). There will be two primary ways to get content into our system: have your CMS send content to us via the i14y API, or send us a list of URLs.</p>

<h2 id="customers-with-content-management-systems-cms">Customers with Content Management Systems (CMS)</h2>

<h3 id="preferred-option-i14y-content-indexing-api-i14y">Preferred Option: i14y Content Indexing API (i14y)</h3>

<p>Since 2015, we’ve offered an API called <a href="https://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/i14y.html">i14y</a>. I14y receives real-time content updates, which gives you full control over your search results. You can update and remove content, and decide exactly what will be shown as the result title for each item.</p>

<p>We are excited to get additional CMS customers using this powerful feature.</p>

<h4 id="customers-with-drupal---we-have-a-drupal-module-for-i14y">Customers with Drupal - We have a Drupal module for i14y!</h4>

<p>For customers who use Drupal as their CMS, our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch">Drupal module</a> eliminates the need for programming effort around the i14y API. This module is available for websites in Drupal 7 and 8.</p>

<h4 id="customers-with-drupal--content-not-in-the-cms">Customers with Drupal + Content not in the CMS</h4>

<p>If your site is on Drupal but you also have published material outside of Drupal (such as PDFs or old web pages), we’ll be able to search both CMS and non-CMS content together.</p>

<p>Your non-CMS material will be indexed via the URL method described below, while your Drupal content will come to us via the module. <em>Note:</em> PDFs count as non-CMS content even if they’re attached to Drupal nodes. Drupal doesn’t store the text of PDFs in its tables, so the module can’t send it to us.</p>

<h4 id="customers-with-other-cmss">Customers with other CMSs</h4>

<p>If you use a CMS that’s not Drupal, we encourage you to develop an integration with i14y and open source it so that other agencies can leverage it as well - a rising tide lifts all boats! If you’re unable to develop an integration, however, read on for other options.</p>

<h2 id="customers-without-content-management-systems">Customers without Content Management Systems</h2>

<h3 id="indexing-from-lists-of-urls">Indexing from Lists of URLs</h3>

<p>In FY18, we will have the ability to index content from lists of URLs. You’ll provide a list of URLs so we know what content to index, and we will develop the title and other metadata from the pages you point us to.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to review your page titles and other metadata, and to tidy things up. This will improve not only how results are presented in our system, but improve your SEO for Google and Bing as well.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to send us a list of URLs, please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">schedule a time</a> to talk with us.</p>

<h2 id="customers-who-send-us-rss-feeds">Customers who send us RSS feeds</h2>

<p>For customers who have developed RSS feeds for our system: that process will remain unchanged. We’ve heard from many of you that maintenance is laborious, so you may want to investigate our new approaches, but you don’t have to change anything if you don’t want to.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps-and-action-items">Next Steps and Action Items</h2>

<p>We are excited about our new direction. You can follow our progress by reading our monthly <a href="https://search.digitalgov.gov/tagged/release-notes/">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p><em>CMS customers:</em></p>

<p>We encourage you to set-up and test i14y as soon as possible.</p>

<p><em>Non-CMS Customers:</em></p>

<p>We encourage you to explore how you can compile a list of your site URLs, and to begin thinking about cleaning up your page titles and descriptions. You do not need to send us any information yet. You may want to check out our webinar <a href="https://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/training.html">Structuring Your Site for Better SEO</a> that will give you tips on what sorts of things to be on the watch for.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-questions">Do you have questions?</h3>

<p>You may join us for an open Q&amp;A session on:</p>

<pre><code>Tuesday, October 3rd, 1 PM ET
Call in number: 1-866-816-7357 / Passcode: 929827#
</code></pre>

<p>We also invite you to read our <a href="/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html">FAQs</a>, which we’ll update regularly.</p>

<p>Finally, we welcome you to email <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">questions and comments</a>.</p>

<p>The Search program has grown and evolved since its <a href="/customers.html">inception in September 2000</a>. We look forward to this next phase of service to you and the public.</p>

<p>Happy searching,</p>

<p>The Search.gov Team</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/domains-advanced.html"/>

<p>Is content missing from your search results? Do you want to have RSS content appear in your main page search results?</p>

<p>We offer two ways for you to tell us about content that you want us to fetch and include in our web index: via RSS feed (Supplemental Feed) or manually (via the <a href="#supplemental-urls">Supplemental URLs</a> section).</p>

<p><strong>Note for customers using Collections:</strong> We serve <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a> results from commercial indexes; the instructions below only apply to your main search results.</p>

<p><strong>Note to our i14y customers:</strong> Supplemental content will not appear for customers using our <a href="/developer/i14y.html">i14y content indexing API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adding-content-via-supplemental-feed">Adding Content via Supplemental Feed</h2>

<p>You can use an RSS feed to add URLs. The feed is useful if you’d like to automate the process, add multiple URLs, or both.</p>

<p>Enter the URL of your RSS feed. Click <code>Submit</code>. We’ll fetch each URL in your feed and index the title, description (optional), and the full text of the document/webpage for the items you provide. Please be sure to follow our <a href="/manual/rss.html">schema</a>, and note that we will only index the items that are listed in the feed.</p>

<p>You can see the list of URLs we have indexed from your feed by viewing the Supplemental URLs section.</p>

<p>Delete a URL added via RSS feed by deleting the item from your RSS feed. We’ll remove the URL from our index the next time we fetch your RSS feed (we fetch saved feeds once per day, in the evening in Eastern Time; for brand new feeds, we fetch as soon as you hit <code>Submit</code> on the feed URL).</p>

<p>You can also delete all of the URLs added via the RSS feed by deleting the RSS feed itself.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We can’t restore URLs that don’t exist within your current feed. Please don’t remove items from the feed unless you want them to be removed from the index. You can add a feed that contains up to 1,000 items on your own. If you have a feed that will include more than 1,000 items, please contact us.</p>

<h2 id="adding-content-via-the-supplemental-urls-section">Adding Content via the Supplemental URLs Section</h2>

<p>You can also manually add a specific URL on the Supplemental URLs page. We’ll fetch each URL you add manually and we’ll index the title, description, and the full text of the document/webpage for the link you provide. Note: You can’t manually add a Supplemental URL if it has already been added by via Supplemental feed.</p>

<p>Delete a manually added URL by selecting <code>Remove</code> within the list of supplemental URLs.</p>

<p>The source column in the crawl report shows how you added the URL, via an RSS feed or manually.</p>

<h2 id="how-supplemental-content-appears-on-your-search-results-page">How Supplemental Content Appears on Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p>We display titles as they are provided in the feed or as you entered them manually.</p>

<p>We display descriptions as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a searcher’s term matches terms in the description you provided: We’ll display the description exactly as you provided it.</li>
  <li>If a searcher’s term only matches terms in the full text of the document: We’ll display snippets taken from the full text.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, supplemental content will appear after all Bing commercial search results have been shown. For example, a search on DigitalGov.gov for “serverless architecture” displays results from Bing’s index on page 1.</p>

<p>After hitting ‘next’ to view page 2, supplemental content is served.</p>

<p>If there are no commercial results for a query but there are supplemental content results, we will display the supplemental content on page one.</p>

<h2 id="getting-supplemental-content-to-always-appear-first">Getting Supplemental Content To Always Appear First</h2>

<p>If you would like your supplemental content to always appear first in search results, please <a href="mailto:search@suppot.digitalgov.gov">contact our team</a>. Searchers will first be served any supplemental content results, and are then offered the chance to “search again,” which will lead them to commercial index results.</p>

<p>Please note: if you have any <a href="/manual/rss.html">regular RSS feeds</a> set up in your search site, this regular RSS content will also appear first with the supplemental content, prior to commercial results. If content is present in both types of feed, duplicates will appear in your results.</p>

<p>In the example below, a Supplemental URL appears first, and clicking “Try your search again” will lead to a page of Bing results.</p>

<h2 id="getting-supplemental-content-to-be-your-only-search-results">Getting Supplemental Content To Be Your Only Search Results</h2>

<p>If you would like your supplemental content to be the only results served from your site, please <a href="mailto:search@suppot.digitalgov.gov">contact our team</a>. Searchers will not be offered the chance to “search again” on a commercial index after they exhaust your supplemental content results (see above example).</p>

<p>Please note: if you have any <a href="/manual/rss.html">regular RSS feeds</a> set up in your search site, this regular RSS content will also appear with the supplemental content. If content is present in both types of feed, duplicates will appear in your results.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Are you seeing an error message in the crawled URLs report for your PDF that says, “No content found in document”?

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> To help the public find your web pages when they search on Bing.com, we notify Bing about any URLs you add.

    <updated>2017-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/march-2017.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlighted-features">Highlighted Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Customers can use our <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Supplemental RSS Feed</a> and <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html#supplemental-urls">Supplemental URLs</a> feature to add missing content to their search results or to have complete control over what content appears. Previously, every item had to have a description. Now, descriptions are optional. If there is no description for an item, we’ll display snippets taken from an item’s full text. If a description is provided, we’ll show the description if it has a match with the query; otherwise, we’ll show snippets from the full text. Note: descriptions are still required for our <a href="/manual/rss.html">main RSS feed</a> feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>As of March 1st, we only support federal and District of Columbia websites. We wrapped up our behind-the-scenes work that facilitated this transition.</li>
  <li>Google announced that it is <a href="https://enterprise.google.com/search/products/gss.html">deprecating the Google Site Search API</a>. We use the GSS API to serve Google results in the limited cases where Bing results are not sufficient. We’ve renewed our license and will continue to use GSS until its end date of March 31, 2018. We are investigating how to best mitigate the effect of this deprecation.</li>
  <li>A new help manual page has been added for our <a href="/manual/analytics-alerts.html">Analytics Alert</a> feature. We also revised the pages for <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">adding supplemental content</a> to your search site and <a href="/manual/filter-content.html">filtering URLs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Users who were deactivated from our system still received <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Daily Snapshot</a> emails of their site’s activity. This has been corrected, and deactivated users no longer receive those emails.</li>
  <li>On March 17th, our system was offline for 1 hour. We traced the problem to a specific configuration in our new logging mechanism. We mitigated the issue and will ensure the long term solution is stable.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; Domains</p>

<p>Enter the applicable domains, subdomains, or folders to return results specific to your website. You do not need to include http:// as we recognize domains with or without it.</p>

<h2 id="entire-sites">Entire Site(s)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.</li>
  <li>List yoursite.gov and yoursite2.gov to search multiple sites.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="specific-subdomains">Specific Subdomains</h2>

<ul>
  <li>List www.yoursite.gov to include only the primary ‘www’ domain.</li>
  <li>List subdomain.yoursite.gov to include subdomains.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="specific-directories">Specific Directories</h2>

<p>List yoursite.gov/folder to include folders. Note: this will include all sub-folders (if they exist), i.e. yoursite.gov/folder/folder2.</p>

<p>You cannot specify individual URLs.</p>

<p>Searches that start three or more subfolders deep cannot use our default configuration. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Email us</a> for assistance.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You can <em>exclude</em> specific subdomains or folders using any of the following options.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>List the excluded subdomains or folders in your <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> file. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exclude them by omission. For example, to exclude subdomain3, list only subdomain1.yoursite.gov, subdomain2.yoursite.gov, and subdomain4.yoursite.gov.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> to filter them from your site’s search results. Note that this option should be used only if the other options aren’t feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a id="filter"></a><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> You can remove or filter specific URLs using any of the following options.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Remove the page from your site and return a 404 (Not Found) 401 (Gone), or 301 (Permanently Moved) HTTP status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_meta_tag?csw=1">noindex robots metatag or x-robots tag</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. This blocks them from all crawlers that follow the robots exclusion protocol, including Google.com and Bing.com.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Request the page’s removal using the <a href="http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/block-urls-from-bing-264e560a">Block URLs option in Bing Webaster Tools</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1663419">Remove URLs option in Google Webmaster Tools</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="/manual/filter-content.html">Filter URLs</a> option under the Advanced tab. Note that this option should be used only if the other options aren’t feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? You can tell us about any missing URLs via an RSS feed or manually (the Supplemental Feed and Supplemental URLs options under the <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Advanced</a> tab, respectively). We’ll fetch and index the pages and append them to your web results.</p>

<p>You can filter <em>a single URL</em> from the results on your site. Use it for emergency reasons only (such as spillage of classified information or unintentional publication of a page). Note that this option should be used only if the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/domains.html#filter">other options</a> aren’t feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.</p>

<p>It is not meant to fix the results for entire site, such as for launch or redesign problems. For tips on how to fix these more systemic problems, read our <a href="https://search.gov/manual/redesign.html">Checklist for a Successful Website Redesign</a>.</p>

<p>Entire the full path of the URL, e.g. use https://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml, not usa.gov/citizen/topics.</p>

<p>You can later use the delete option to remove the filter.</p>

<p>Please note: this filtering only affects your search results page that is hosted by our service - it does not affect commercial web results on Google.com, Bing.com, etc.</p>

    <updated>2017-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/analytics-alerts.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Analytics &gt; Analytics Alerts</p>

<p>Analytics Alerts let you receive email alerts when your site visitors are getting no results for a particular query or when a query is getting a <a href="#low-query-click-through-rate">low click-through rate</a>. <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> the Low Click-through Rate alert is not currently functional. We apologize for any inconvience this may cause.</p>

<h2 id="no-results">No Results</h2>

<p>Set up this alert to be notified if specific queries are frequently searched for but are returning no results. Help on specific fields follows, and there is an <a href="#no-results-example">example</a> below.</p>

<p><strong>Name</strong></p>

<p>Enter a name for your alert. It will be the subject line of your alert email. The name of your alert must be unique across our entire search alert system, so if you see an error message, please modify the name.</p>

<p><strong>Check interval</strong></p>

<p>Enter the frequency at which you’d like the system to check for queries with no results. Use <code>m</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>d</code>, or <code>w</code> to specify the minutes/hours/days/weeks you’d like between checks.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum number of queries</strong></p>

<p>Enter the minimum number of times, over the time window, that a given query must be entered to trigger the alert.</p>

<p><strong>Time window for each check</strong></p>

<p>Enter the amount of time the system should look back through for each check. Use <code>m</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>d</code>, or <code>w</code> to specify minutes/hours/days/weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Time between alerts</strong></p>

<p>Enter the minimum period of time between successive email messages.</p>

<p><strong>Ignored query terms</strong></p>

<p>Enter any query terms that you don’t want included in the alert, separated by commas.</p>

<h3 id="no-results-example">No Results Example:</h3>

<p>In this example, the alert system will check every 30 minutes to see if any query has been entered at least 50 times over the past 12 hours and yielded no results. The system will send an alert at most once per day if there are queries that fit this criteria, and it will not include the query ‘panda’ in the alert.</p>

<p><img src="https://search.digitalgov.gov/img/No-Results-Screenshot.png" alt="No Results Analytics Alert Example" title="No Results Analytics Alert Example" height="95%" width="95%" /></p>

<h2 id="low-query-click-through-rate">Low Query Click-through Rate</h2>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> the Low Click-through Rate alert is not currently functional. We apologize for any inconvience this may cause.</p>

<p>Set up this alert to be notified if the results page for a query with significant traffic is not getting many clicks. If the query resulted in a click less than 20% of the time, it is considered to have a low click-through rate (CTR); however, you are able to set any percentage threshold for your alert emails. Help on specific fields follows, and there is an <a href="#low-ctr-example">example</a> below.</p>

<p><strong>Name</strong></p>

<p>Enter a name for your alert. It will be the subject line of your email. The name of your alert must be unique across our entire search alert system, so if you see an error message, please modify the name.</p>

<p><strong>Check interval</strong></p>

<p>Enter the frequency at which you’d like the system to check for queries with a low CTR. Use <code>m</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>d</code>, or <code>w</code> to specify the minutes/hours/days/weeks you’d like between checks.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum search activity level (queries + clicks)</strong></p>

<p>Enter the minimum number of times, over the time window, that a given query must have search activity (queries plus clicks) to trigger the low query CTR alert. Because we’re not able to differentiate between query activity and click activity, you may want to pad this number a little. However, since these queries are not getting a lot of clicks, you don’t want to pad it too much.</p>

<p><strong>Maximum CTR for alert</strong></p>

<p>Enter the maximum click-through rate that will trigger an alert, expressed as a percentage. You will receive an alert for a query that has a CTR equal to or lower than that percentage during the given time window.</p>

<p><strong>Time window for each check</strong></p>

<p>Enter the amount of time the system should look back through for each check. Use <code>m</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>d</code>, or <code>w</code> to specify minutes/hours/days/weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Time between alerts</strong></p>

<p>Enter the minimum period of time between successive email messages.</p>

<p><strong>Ignored query terms</strong></p>

<p>Enter any query terms that you don’t want included in the alert, separated by commas.</p>

<h3 id="low-ctr-example">Low CTR Example:</h3>

<p>In this example, the alert system will check every 30 minutes for a query that has had search activity (queries plus clicks) at least 100 times over the past 12 hours and has a CTR 15% or lower. The system will send an alert at most once per day if there are queries that fit these criteria, and it will not include queries for ‘lion’ in the alert.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Don’t forget to hit ‘add’ in the upper right corner!</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> Analytics alerts are only sent to the Search.gov user who set up the alert.</p>

<p>Either URL format works.</p>

<h2 id="opt-to-display-your-videos">Opt to Display Your Videos</h2>

<p>When you add the URL for your YouTube channel, we’ll automatically index your videos—both your uploaded videos and playlists.</p>

<p>We’ll show the videos by default. You can toggle the settings for showing your videos on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page, choosing to show them as a facet, inline module, or both.</p>

<p>Search.gov got its start when Internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research was funded by the Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to government. That gift helped accelerate the government’s earlier work to create a government-wide portal.</p>

<p>In June 2000, President Clinton announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Brewer, and instructed that an official U.S. web portal be launched within 90 days. USA.gov went online on September 22, 2000 under the name FirstGov.gov with a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001109105200/http://www.firstgov.gov">prominent search box</a> to allow the public to search across government websites. Visit USA.gov to learn more <a href="https://www.usa.gov/about">about its mission and history</a>.</p>

<p>In 2010, Search.gov moved to open-source software and became available to agencies across government in the United States to power the search boxes on their site. Today we power nearly 300 million queries a year through over 1,800 federal search configurations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; Add Site</p>

<h2 id="homepage-url">Homepage URL</h2>

<p>Tell us the homepage URL of your website. Enter a fully qualified URL, including http://, http://www, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Correct Syntax</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>https://www.whitehouse.gov</li>
  <li>https://gobierno.usa.gov</li>
  <li>https://stemcells.nih.gov</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Incorrect Syntax</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>usa.gov (use https://www.usa.gov)</li>
  <li>www.nasa.gov (use https://www.nasa.gov)</li>
  <li>https://www.sec.gov/litigation.shtml (use the higher-level folder, https://www.sec.gov/litigation)</li>
  <li>https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000?utm_source=OCM&amp;utm_medium=print-radio&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=shortcuts (use the higher-level domain, https://www.gsa.gov)</li>
  <li>http://www.doc.gov (use the domain that resolves, https://www.commerce.gov)</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this homepage URL to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Seed your <a href="/manual/domains.html">domains</a> list.</li>
  <li>Scan for any social media accounts (<a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a>, <a href="/manual/instagram.html">Instagram</a>, <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a>, and <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a>), your favicon to use on your search results browser tab, and <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a> that are linked from your homepage, or another page you specify on the Display Overview page.</li>
  <li>Link the default <a href="/manual/brand.html">logo</a> on your results page to your homepage.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="display-name">Display Name</h2>

<p><a href="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/DisplayName_SiteHandle_800.png"><img style="float: right;" src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/DisplayName_SiteHandle_175.png" alt="Display Name and Site Handle on NIH.gov's search results page" /></a>Tell us the name of your website. Searchers see your display name on the results page, such as in your page title or best bets. We recommend using the plain language name for your agency or site, such as National Institutes of Health.</p>

<h2 id="site-handle">Site Handle</h2>

<p>Your site handle is a unique identifier for your site. The site handle is included in the request you send us from your search box, to let us know which search site to use. We also include it in the URL of your search results page, again, to show which search site is being used. We recommend making this handle short and unique, such as <code>nih</code>.</p>

<p>Handles can have lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores only. They can’t have spaces and other punctuation.</p>

<h2 id="site-language">Site Language</h2>

<p>English is the default language for our results pages. If you will be searching against content in another language, you should choose another language for your search site - we support English, Spanish, and <a href="/manual/supported-languages.html">66 other languages</a>.</p>

<p>When English is selected, results will primarily include English language pages. All display text on the results page will also be in English.</p>

<p>If you select Spanish, results will primarily include Spanish language pages. All display text on the results page will also be in Spanish. (Localizations are provided by GSA’s <a href="https://gobierno.usa.gov/">GobiernoUSA.gov</a> team.)</p>

<p>If you select one of the other <a href="/manual/supported-languages.html">69 languages</a>, results will primarily include pages from the selected language when possible. Display text will be in the selected language when localizations are available, and in English when they’re not available.</p>

<p>We’ve published the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/punchcard/tree/master/localizations">localization files</a> on Github, and we encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/GSA/punchcard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute</a> to them.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> For non-English sites, some agencies opt to include the specific location of the language’s content (such as agency.gov/language or language.agency.gov) in their <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> to further refine the search results. Test the results for your non-English site with both the general agency.gov and the language-specific location to determine which setting gives you the best results.</p>

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting Tip:</em></strong> Once you’ve added your site, you can edit your display name on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page. If you later need to edit your site handle or language, email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a>.</p>

    <id>https://search.gov/tos.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following terms of service (“Terms”) governing the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Search.gov website and services, including the content, documentation, code and related materials, are offered subject to your acceptance of the Terms as well as any relevant sections of the DigitalGov <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/about/policies/">Site Policies</a> (collectively, the “Agreement”). Access to or use of Search.gov services or its content constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection-and-use">Data Collection and Use</h2>

<h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When you use Search.gov, we store information about searches on your site, including: the web page from which searchers accessed your search results, the date and time, the words searched for, items clicked on a page, and standard HTTP request data, including the browser and operating system used. We periodically delete our search logs.</li>
  <li>We use this information to measure the usage of our website and services and to identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us develop the service, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the service more useful. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We may anonymize and provide this information to third-party entities for the purposes of analyzing search traffic.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="secondary-use">Secondary Use</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Customers using our Search Results API cannot cache results.</li>
  <li>Data accessed through our website and services does not, and should not, include controls over its end use.</li>
  <li>Once the data has been downloaded from Search.gov, we can’t vouch for the quality or timeliness of any analyses conducted with data retrieved.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="citing-data">Citing Data</h2>

<p>Customers using the Search Results API must display the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/4/E/04E076D4-60B2-4D31-BCC7-C4805B558DBB/Bing%20product%20guidelines.pdf">Powered by Bing</a> [PDF] logo on ‘web’ and ‘image’ search results pages for attribution of these results. Customers using any of the other three indexes (‘docs’, ‘news’, and ‘videonews’) must display “Powered by Search.gov” (using plain text or <a href="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/searchdotgovlogo.png">our logo</a> for Search.gov) for attribution instead of the Bing logo.</p>

<h2 id="source-code">Source Code</h2>

<h3 id="use-of-open-source-software">Use of Open Source Software</h3>

<p>Search.gov uses open-source software and free or low cost, commercial application programming interfaces when it best meets the needs and mission of GSA.</p>

<h3 id="redistribution-of-code">Redistribution of Code</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Software source code written entirely by GSA staff, and by contractors who are developing software on behalf of GSA, is by default a public domain work.</li>
  <li>Software source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by GSA staff is considered a “joint work.” It is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open-source license.</li>
  <li>All source code as defined above may be shared with the general public via a highly visible, easily accessible online source code community (such as Github) that facilitates the code’s reuse. Source code won’t be released if any of the following conditions are met:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>The author of the code determines that the code is too crude to merit distribution or provide value to the broader community.</li>
  <li>The Government doesn’t have the rights to reproduce and release the item. The Government has public release rights when the software is developed by Government personnel, when the Government receives “unlimited rights” in software developed by a contractor at Government expense, or when pre-existing OSS is modified by or for the Government.</li>
  <li>The public release of the item is restricted by other law or regulation, such as the Export Administration Regulations or the International Traffic in Arms Regulation.</li>
  <li>GSA cybersecurity staff determine that the public release of such code would pose an unacceptable risk to GSA’s operational security.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modification-or-false-representation-of-content">Modification or False Representation of Content</h2>

<p>You may not modify or falsely represent content accessed through Search.gov yet still claim the source is Search.gov.</p>

<h2 id="right-to-limit">Right to Limit</h2>

<p>Users of the website and services must have a valid government email address from a federal or District of Columbia government agency. If GSA reasonably believes that you are not a federal or District of Columbia government employee, or a contractor acting within the scope of its contract with the federal or District of Columbia government, GSA may permanently block your use of the website and services.</p>

<p>Use of the APIs may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by GSA. If GSA reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the API may be permanently or temporarily blocked.</p>

<p>GSA may monitor your use of its services to improve the service or to ensure compliance with this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="service-termination">Service Termination</h2>

<p>If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of the website and services. GSA reserves the right (though not the obligation) to (1) refuse to provide the services to you if it is GSA’s opinion that use violates any GSA policy, or (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of the services at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. Any hosted applications may also be shut down or removed. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>GSA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, in whole or in part. Your continued use of or access to the Search.gov services following posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those modified terms. GSA may, in the future, offer new services and/or features. Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer-of-warranties">Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p>Search.gov services are provided “as is” and on an “as-available” basis. GSA hereby disclaims all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. GSA makes no warranty that the services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-on-liability">Limitations on Liability</h2>

<p>In no event will GSA be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; or (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data.</p>

<h2 id="general-representations">General Representations</h2>

<p>You hereby warrant that (1) your use of the website and services will be in strict accordance with the Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations, and (2) your use of the website and services will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<h2 id="disputes">Disputes</h2>

<p>Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the services shall be governed by federal law.</p>

<h2 id="no-waiver-of-rights">No Waiver of Rights</h2>

<h2 id="federal-government">Federal Government</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Federal Cross-Agency Portals.</strong> If your website is a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the Job Openings module will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all federal agencies</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Federal Department Websites.</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the Job Openings module will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings <em>across all agencies within your department</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Federal Agency or Office Websites.</strong> If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the Job Openings module will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings <em>at your agency</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Searchers will also see a direct link to <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov">USAJobs.gov</a> for all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable), as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://search.doi.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=doi.gov&amp;query=jobs&quot;"><em>jobs</em></a> on DOI.gov.</p>

<h2 id="tell-us-about-your-flickr-photostream">Tell Us About Your Flickr Photostream</h2>

<p>Provide us with the <em>full URL</em> for your Flickr photostream. Most photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa">https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa</a> for HUD). Some photostreams are in the groups folder (such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov">https://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov</a> for USA.gov).</p>

<p>The URL must be for your overall photostream. You cannot specify individual photos, sets, favorites, or maps.</p>

<h2 id="opt-to-display-your-flickr-images">Opt to Display Your Flickr Images</h2>

<p>When you add the URL for your Flickr photostream, we’ll automatically index all of the images in your photostream.</p>

<p>On the image results page, we’ll display the images from your Flickr photostream by default. If you’d like to backfill them with the standard image results from your website, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> and we’ll turn on your web images for you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Display &gt; Display Overview</p>

<h2 id="facets">Facets</h2>

<p><strong>Label.</strong> By default, we use the label ‘Search’ for your facets. Enter a label in the label field if you’d like something other than this default. Keep your label consistent with the options you’re listing and under 15 characters.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows the facets with the default label, Search, displayed for a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=passport">search on <em>passport</em> on USA.gov</a>. (It is most easily seen by clicking on the menu option from a mobile phone.)</p>

<p><strong>On/off options for facets.</strong> Select which facets you’d like to appear on your results page. Turn an option on to allow searchers to see it. Turn an option on or off at any time.</p>

<p>Type over the text in the Name field to edit a facet’s display name. Keep each name short (15 or fewer characters) and consistent with the content you’re searching. Click on the hyperlink in the Source field to update the facet’s source content. Hover over the icon with three horizontal lines on the left to change the order.</p>

<p><strong>More.</strong> We show up to four facets above your search box. If you turn on the display of more than four facets, you’ll see them listed under a ‘More’ dropdown menu. Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> if you’d like to use a custom label instead of the default ‘More’.</p>

<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>

<p><strong>On/off options for modules.</strong> Turn on a module to allow searchers to see inline, contextually relevant results for selected content sources based on keyword matches with relevant queries. There are eight types of modules.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>News.</strong> This option only appears after you’ve told us about your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds. When a searcher’s query matches the title of an RSS article published within the past four months, the article appears in the News module. Very recent news results (less than five days) appear at the top of the page and less recent news results appear at the bottom. Up to three articles are displayed. Type over the default name, News, in the Name field to edit the display name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Videos.</strong> This option only appears after you’ve told us about your <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a> channel. When a searcher’s query matches the metadata of a video published within the 13 months, the video appears in the Videos module. One inline video is displayed with a link to see more videos for the searcher’s query.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Job openings.</strong> When a searcher’s query matches the text of a job opening published by your agency on USAJobs, the job appears in the Job Openings module. Up to three job openings are displayed. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Help Searchers Find Jobs</a>. You will need to <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact us</a> to get the Jobs module enabled for your site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Federal Register</em> documents.</strong> When a searcher’s query matches the text of a notice or rule published by your agency in the <em>Federal Register</em>, the document appears in the <em>Federal Register</em> module. Up to three documents are displayed. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-federal-register.html">Help Searchers Find Federal Register Documents</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Related searches.</strong> Help visitors better define the focus of their search by offering them searches related to their current search term. Suggestions are derived from the searches performed on your website. Up to five searches related to your visitors’ original search are displayed and are updated in near real time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Health topics.</strong> Help searchers find high-quality, authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov. For more information, including a screenshot, read our post <a href="/manual/govbox-health.html">Help Searchers Find Health Information</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recent tweets.</strong> This option only appears after you’ve told us about your <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a> account. When a searcher’s query matches the text of a tweet published within the past three days, the tweet appears in the Recent Tweets module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Type-ahead search.</strong> Help searchers refine their query by displaying type-ahead search suggestions as a list in the search box. The list forms as a searcher begins to type in the search box. Suggestions are listed in order of most popular (that is, most searched). They’re updated every few seconds. See, for example, the suggestions as you type di… on <a href="https://search.ssa.gov/search?affiliate=ssa">SocialSecurity.gov’s search results page</a>. <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> this will enable type-ahead on your search results page that is hosted by our service. If you wish to display type-ahead suggestions on your agency’s website, please review instructions for our <a href="/manual/typeahead-api.html">JavaScript snippet and API</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="related-sites">Related Sites</h2>

<p>Help visitors find content relevant to their search query that resides on other websites, such as the site for your parent organization or your Spanish-language site. When searchers click on the link to the related site, they see search results for their query on the related site.</p>

<p>Enter the <a href="/manual/settings.html">site handle</a> for one of your other Search.gov sites. Enter the text you’d like searchers to see for the link to the related site. Create two entries, one from the first site to the second and vice versa, if you’d like a reciprocal link.</p>

<p>See, for example, the Español option displayed on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=venezuela&amp;affiliate=usagov">USA.gov for a search on <em>venezuela</em></a>. When searchers click this option, they see results for <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=venezuela&amp;affiliate=gobiernousa"><em>venezuela</em> on GobiernoUSA.gov</a>.</p>

<p>If you list more than two related sites, searchers will see them listed under a dropdown menu, View Topic.</p>

<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> if you’d like to use a custom label instead of the default ‘View Topic’ label.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong>  Searchers may narrow results by time period for any <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds. See, for example, results for a <a href="https://nasasearch.nasa.gov/search/news?affiliate=nasa&amp;channel=1618&amp;query=space&amp;sort_by=date&amp;tbs=w">search on <em>space</em> narrowed to press releases in the last week on NASA.gov</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong>  For any of your <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds that you’ve extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> property, searchers may narrow results by the three facets. We’ll display “Contributor,” “Publisher,” and “Subject” as the default names. Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> to if you want to customize these display names.</p>

    <updated>2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/content-overview.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; Content Overview</p>

<p>To display the results on your search results page, we index content from various sources. Each time a searcher enters a query on your site, we determine which indexes answer the searcher’s question and display results from them. This means a single search results page often includes items from several indexes.</p>

<p>When you first <a href="/manual/add-site.html">add a site</a>, we pull the homepage you listed into your <a href="/manual/domains.html">domains</a> list, and populate any social media accounts (<a href="/manual/flickr.html">Flickr</a>, <a href="/manual/twitter.html">Twitter</a>, and <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube</a>) and <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a> that are linked from your homepage. Use the Discover option on this Content Overview page to automatically (re)discover the RSS and social media accounts on your site’s homepage, or any other page you want to scan.</p>

<p>You can also add content manually to each of the sections listed above.</p>

<h2 id="add-your-web-pages">Add Your Web Pages</h2>

<p>When you <a href="/manual/domains.html">add your domains</a>, we’ll show results for all of your web pages listed within these domains. <strong><em>By default, these web results are powered by Bing.</em></strong></p>

<p>If you don’t like the default web results, you can choose to use another index. Options follow.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1. Use Our Search.gov Web Index.</strong> We can index content that is sent to us by API or RSS. Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> and we’ll work with you to determine the best way for us to get your content.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2. Use Another Web Index of Your Choice.</strong> Most search indexes expose their results as XML. If you have another search index that renders XML, let us know and we’ll work with you to determine if you can use it.</p>

<p>Once you’ve added your web pages, you can create <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collections</a> to give searchers the option to narrow (or, less frequently, broaden) the results to a specific subset of pages.</p>

<h2 id="add-your-images">Add Your Images</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Flickr.</strong> When you <a href="/manual/flickr.html">add your Flickr URL</a>, we’ll index your Flickr photostream.</li>
  <li><strong>Photo Galleries on Your Site.</strong> Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency’s images? When you <a href="/manual/rss.html">add a media RSS</a> (MRSS) for your gallery, we’ll index its images.</li>
  <li><strong>Images on Your Web Pages.</strong> We backfill the image results from social media and photo galleries with the images published on the web pages of the <a href="/manual/domains.html">domain(s) you’ve added</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-your-videos">Add Your Videos</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>YouTube.</strong> When you <a href="/manual/youtube.html">add your YouTube account</a>, we’ll index your YouTube videos. We will also index any videos in your playlists.</li>
  <li><strong>Video Galleries on Your Site.</strong> Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency’s videos? When you <a href="/manual/rss.html">add a media RSS</a> (MRSS) for your gallery, we’ll index its videos.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-your-news">Add Your News</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>RSS Feeds.</strong> Do you have RSS feeds set up for your press releases, blog posts, or other newsworthy content? When you <a href="/manual/rss.html">add an RSS</a>, we’ll index the items on that feed.</li>
  <li><strong>Twitter.</strong> Does your agency use Twitter? You can <a href="/manual/twitter.html">add your Twitter handle</a>, and we’ll index your tweets. You have the option of asking us to index the tweets from other Twitter users that you maintain in public lists on Twitter. Because tweets are ephemeral, we display tweets from the past three days when they match a searcher’s query.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-your-recommendations">Add Your Recommendations</h2>

<p>Create <a href="/manual/best-bets.html">Best Bets (Text or Graphics)</a> to promote specific results. Best Bets appear at the top of the results page when a searcher’s query matches the text of their titles, descriptions, or keywords.</p>

<h2 id="turn-it-all-on">Turn It All On</h2>

<p>After you’ve added your content, be sure to <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">set the display options</a> to control how each index appears on your search results page.</p>

<p>We also have three pre-built, government-centric content modules that you can opt to turn on, too.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Job Openings.</strong> Toggle on the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs module</a> to show your agency’s job openings from USAJobs.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Federal Register</em> Documents.</strong> Toggle on the <a href="/manual/govbox-federal-register.html"><em>Federal Register</em> module</a> to show your agency’s documents posted on FederalRegister.gov.</li>
  <li><strong>Health Topics.</strong> Toggle on the <a href="/manual/govbox-health.html">Health Topics module</a> to show authoritative health information from MedlinePlus and ClinicalTrials.gov.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Troubleshooting tip:</em></strong> We’ve connected your site to your agency on the backend. If you’re not seeing jobs or <em>Federal Register</em> documents specific to your agency, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> so we can fix the agency setting for your site.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Activate Your Search by Adding Our Code Snippets to Your Website]]></title>
    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/code.html"/>
    <updated>2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/code.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Activate Search &gt; Code Snippets</p>

<p>Visit our <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>, select your site, and click on the Activate Search option in the left-hand menu.</p>

<p>Add the following two snippets of code to your website to “hook” your website and our hosted search service together. You can add this code to your individual web pages or to the template(s) in your content management system.</p>

<h2 id="1-form-snippet">1. Form Snippet</h2>

<p>Include this snippet of code where the form for your search box appears. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="2-javascript-snippet">2. Javascript Snippet</h2>

<p>Include this snippet of code before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. This tag enables type-ahead search in the search box on your web pages and powers the data on trending URLs on the <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Site Overview</a> page in the Admin Center. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
      var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };

      var script = document.createElement("script");
      script.type = "text/javascript";
      script.src = "//search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
      document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);

//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="advanced-options-for-limiting-a-search-box-to-specific-folders-or-subdomains">Advanced: Options for Limiting a Search Box to Specific Folders or Subdomains</h2>

<p>You can limit results to specific folders or subdomains by creating a collection, setting up an RSS feed, or passing in a hidden value.</p>

<h3 id="option-1-limit-to-collections">Option 1. Limit to Collections</h3>

<p>Create a <a href="/manual/collections.html">collection</a>. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="https://search.usa.gov/search/docs/</code> and (b) add an input for this collection, <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;</code>. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://search.usa.gov/search/docs/" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center as shown in the sample below.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/get-code-collection.png" alt="Value for the collection ID" /></p>

<h3 id="option-2-limit-to-rss-feeds">Option 2. Limit to RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>Set up an <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feed</a>. Then update your form code to (a) change the action to <code>action="https://search.usa.gov/search/news/</code> and (b) add an input for this feed, <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;</code>.  It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://search.usa.gov/search/news/" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###"&gt;
    &lt;input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&amp;#x2713;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Enter Search Term(s):&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value is the number for your RSS ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit or preview your feed in the Admin Center.</p>

<h3 id="option-3-limit-to-a-hidden-domain-value">Option 3. Limit to a Hidden Domain Value</h3>

<p>Leave your domain blank on the <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> page and, instead, pass a hidden value for the domain in the search form code.</p>

<p>For example, on health.agency.gov, the following hidden value would be added to limit results to only the health subdomain.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="sitelimit" id="sitelimit" value="www.health.agency.gov" &gt;
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlighted-features">Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="i14y-drawer-management">i14y Drawer Management</h3>

<p>We updated the process for removing <a href="/manual/i14y-drawers.html">i14y Drawers</a> from a search configuration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you remove a drawer that is associated with only one search configuration, it will be deleted from our system.</li>
  <li>If you remove a drawer that is attached to multiple search configurations, it will be removed from only the one configuration and will remain attached to the others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-results-page-platform-launches">New Results Page Platform Launches</h3>

<p>We launched our new JavaScript search results page, which is serving the search results on IRS.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/new-serp.png" alt="New JavaScript results page" width="100%" /></p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Have your RSS feeds transitioned from <code>HTTP</code> to <code>HTTPS</code>? Our system now recognizes that transition automatically.</li>
  <li>We indexed and support the search for whitehouse.gov. We prepared indexes to go live at noon January 20, for the obamawhitehouse.archives.gov sites, as well as the new content on whitehouse.gov.</li>
  <li>We’ve updated the process around password reset links.
    <ul>
      <li>Password reset links are only valid for one hour: previously, if you requested a password reset link more than once within the hour, the first link would expire. This caused confusion for many users who accidentally hit the reset link twice and were encountering expired links.</li>
      <li>Now, we will resend you the first, valid link for a period of one hour, regardless of how many times you hit the reset button.</li>
      <li>We’ve also updated and clarified the message you see if you click an expired link.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We finalized adding all our active repos to the <a href="https://code.gov">Code.gov</a> inventory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Our excellent asset caching was inadvertently prolonging transient errors by serving up cached error responses. We’ve fixed this so errors will really go away when they’ve cleared.</li>
  <li>We also added a response code passthrough to make sure that, in our multiserver environment, we don’t end up returning <code>200</code> responses just because an error page is working just fine. We are now passing through the response code reported by the error page.</li>
  <li>We fixed a bug where some password reset tokens were delivering users to the login page, when they should have been delivered to the password reset page.</li>
  <li>We fixed an error that was interfering with our import of Federal Register documents for indexing.</li>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/third-party.html"/>
    <updated>2017-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/third-party.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Analytics &gt; 3rd Party Tracking</p>

<p>Do you want your search results page to run third-party web services such as Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, Siteimprove, or WebTrends?</p>

<p>Input the JavaScript code you’d like to call from your search results page. Click submit to send us your request. We’ll input your code for you and send you an email to confirm that we’ve done it.</p>

<p>Some tips for commonly used third-party web services follow.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: We do not currently support Google Tag Manager. You will need to submit all of the scripts you are managing in your Google Tag Manager setup.</p>

<h2 id="google-analytics-tip">Google Analytics Tip</h2>

<p>Within your Google Analytics account, select the option, <em>Do Track Site Search</em>. Set the query parameter as <em>query</em>. For more information, read Google’s tip, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012264?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1031951">Set Up and Configure Site Search</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you’ve requested <a href="cname.html">domain masking</a> and you want to include the analytics for your <em>search.agency.gov</em> subdomain with your main <em>agency.gov</em> domain, you’ll need to set your domain in your Google Analytics JavaScript by including <code>_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'agency.gov']);</code>.</p>

<p>For more information, read Google’s tip, <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite">Tracking Multiple Domains</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</p>

<p>The code you submit should look something like one of the following two scripts.</p>

<h3 id="google-analytics-code-older-format">Google Analytics Code (Older Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var _gaq = _gaq || []; 
 _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-########-1']); 
 _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);
 
 (function() { 
 var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; 
 ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl'; : 'http://www') +      '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; 
 var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s); 
 })();
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="google-analytics-code-newer-format">Google Analytics Code (Newer Format)</h3>

<pre><code> &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="digital-analytics-program-tip">Digital Analytics Program Tip</h2>

<p>Does your federal agency participate in the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP)?  You don’t need to do anything. We’re already fully integrated with DAP.</p>

<h2 id="foresee-tip">ForeSee Tip</h2>

<p>Coordinate with your ForeSee representative and the Search.gov team to implement your customer satisfaction survey on your results page. The four general steps follow.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> to <a href="cname.html">set up a CNAME</a> for search.youragency.gov.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update the files path in your Foresee code to use an absolute path instead of a relative path.</p>

    <p><strong>Find =&gt;</strong> ‘files’: ‘/fsrscripts/’,</p>

    <p><strong>and replace it with =&gt;</strong> ‘files’: ‘//www.youragency.gov/fsrscripts/’,</p>

    <p><em>(Or, find =&gt; ‘files’: ‘/foresee/’, and replace it with =&gt; ‘files’: ‘//www.youragency/foresee/’,)</em></p>

    <p>in the following five files.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>foresee-trigger.js</li>
      <li>foresee-tracker.js</li>
      <li>foresee-alive.js</li>
      <li>foresee-qualifier.js</li>
      <li>foresee-test.js</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your foresee-trigger.js via our Admin Center. It should look something like the following script. <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//www.youragency.gov/library/foresee/foresee-trigger.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ll send you an email to confirm that we’ve set up both your CNAME and added the script for your foresee-trigger.js file.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlighted-features">Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="password-management">Password Management</h3>

<p>The password change page now requires confirmation of your previous password. We also now require complex passwords, including 8 or more characters, and a combination of character types and cases.</p>

<h3 id="crawling-and-indexing">Crawling and Indexing</h3>

<p>We are exploring how we can use our own crawler for a subset of our customers’ search configurations. The goal is to serve more results directly from our own indexes, rather than leveraging commercial indexes. We recognize that not all agency customers are able to send us their content via API or RSS, and we also recognize that agencies are interested in having more control over when their content gets indexed, which is not possible with the commercial crawlers.</p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>On December 15th, Bing <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bingdevcenter/2016/11/04/azure-data-market-bing-search-and-web-results-only-apis-to-be-decommissioned-december-15/">deprecated 2 of its APIs</a>. We successfully (and invisibly!) handled this transition for all search configurations that use our hosted search results page.
    <ul>
      <li>Related to this, we updated our search results API instructions in our Admin Center.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In line with the <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">HTTPS-only mandate</a>, we are now serving traffic only over <code>HTTPS</code>. We updated our <a href="/manual/">help manual</a> and the code snippets you see in the Admin Center to reflect this change.</li>
  <li>We ran (and are continuing to run) bulk updates to some URLs that are still listed as <code>HTTP</code> in our system but can be accessed over <code>HTTPS</code>.  This bulk update applies to URLs in the following features:
    <ul>
      <li>RSS feeds</li>
      <li>Supplemental URLs</li>
      <li>Supplemental RSS feeds</li>
      <li>Best Bets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Our new JavaScript search results page now appears correctly in all modern versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer, and on both Windows and Mac computers.</li>
  <li>We fixed an issue where our multi-server AWS environment was interfering with our <a href="govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/vocab/index.php">Government URLs inventory database</a>.</li>
  <li>We fixed an error that was blocking our uploads to Bing’s temporary index.</li>

    <link href="https://search.gov/manual/collections.html"/>
    <updated>2016-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/manual/collections.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Collections</p>

<p>Would you like searchers to be able to change where they are searching, either to a particular place within your site, or to another site? You can create a collection that will search in any set of domains, subdomains, or subfolders.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-create-a-collection">Step 1. Create a Collection</h2>

<p>Enter a name for the collection (such as FAQs, Archive, or News).</p>

<p>Enter the domains, subdomains, or subfolders that you want this collection to search in. Start each URL prefix with http:// and end it in a trailing slash to avoid unintended matches (e.g., https://publications.agency.gov/docs/ and https://answers.agency.gov).</p>

<p>You cannot specify URLs for individual web pages. If you are including a subfolder, be sure to include the folder(s) where the files are actually stored, not the folder where the index page lives.</p>

<p>Paths that are three or more subfolders deep may not return results immediately. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Email us</a> if you are not seeing search results for these paths.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-opt-to-show-as-a-facet">Step 2. Opt to Show as a Facet</h2>

<p>Click on the <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">Display Overview</a> page. Turn on your collection to allow searchers to see it as a search facet in the navigation bar above the search box on the results page (in the desktop view), or in the search menu (on smaller screens).</p>

<h2 id="step-3-check-your-search-results-page">Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page</h2>

<p>Searchers will see the collection name as an option that they can select in order to focus their search.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/manual-collection-2.png" alt="Collection on the search results page" /></p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> You can set up a search box on your website that limits results to your collection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with the standard form snippet on the <a href="/manual/code.html">Code Snippets</a> page under the Activate Search tab.</li>
  <li>Change the form action from <code>action="https://search.usa.gov/search/"</code> to <code>action="https://search.usa.gov/search/docs"</code>.</li>
  <li>Add the following line to limit the results to your collection: <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="###"&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The value is the number for your collection ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your collection in the Admin Center.</p>

<p>See the sample search box below that is limited to news on <a href="https://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&amp;dc=565&amp;query=autism">NIH.gov for a search on <em>autism</em></a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/manual-collection-3.png" alt="News-only search box on NIH.gov's News Releases page" height="95%" width="95%" /></p>

<p><a href="https://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&amp;dc=565&amp;query=autism"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/manual-collection-4.png" alt="NIH.gov news-only search results page" title="NIH.gov news-only search results page" /></a></p>

<p><a name="sitelimit"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> If you don’t want to set up a Collection, you can use the <code>sitelimit</code> parameter to search a subset of your content. Compare the collection-based results above with the results for <a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nih&amp;query=autism&amp;sitelimit=nih.gov/news">the same search using the sitelimit parameter</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to nih.gov/news in a message under the search box, among other differences.</p>

<p>Simply add the following line to your form code on your search box to use the <code>sitelimit</code> parameter.</p>

<p><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="sitelimit" id="sitelimit" value="www.agency.gov/limittothisfolder"&gt;</code></p>

<p>This third lecture honoring Joe focused on search engine optimization (SEO).</p>

<p>While commercial search engines do a remarkable job of helping the public find our government information, as web professionals, it’s also our job to help the public make sense of what they find.</p>

<p>Ammie Farraj Feijoo, our program manager, presented on SEO for government websites and specifically talked about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What SEO is and why it is important;</li>
  <li>SEO building blocks for writing content;</li>
  <li>Conducting keyword research; and</li>
  <li>Eliminating ROT (redundant, outdated, and trivial content).</li>

<p>Below is a checklist of action items that should be completed in order for your search site to function as expected in HTTPS.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-admin-center">1. The Admin Center</h2>

<p>Update all URLs that are listed in the Search Admin Center for each of your search configurations. <em>You will need to update the links for all of your search configurations.</em></p>

<h3 id="everyone">Everyone:</h3>

<p><strong>Dashboard:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Update your Homepage URL.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Analytics:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3rd Party Tracking:</strong> If you are using <a href="/manual/third-party.html">3rd party tracking code</a> that is HTTP protocol-specific, you will need to submit updated code.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Content:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Content Overview:</strong> No action needed. The URL that we scan for social media accounts is synced with the homepage you have listed in the Dashboard section.</li>
  <li><strong>Domains:</strong> No action needed, as this list isn’t protocol-specific.</li>
  <li><strong>Collections:</strong> Update all URL paths in your collections; if you have mixed collections, leave any HTTP sites as-is.</li>
  <li><strong>Best Bets (Text and Graphics):</strong> Throughout December 2016, we are doing bulk updates of Best Bet URLs in our system. If your site is serving content over HTTPS, we will update the URLs for your Best Bets. We suggest doing a spotcheck to confirm that all Best Bets have been updated. If you need a bulk update done after December, please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Routed Queries:</strong> Update routed query URLs.</li>
  <li><strong>RSS feeds:</strong> Throughout December 2016, we are doing bulk updates of RSS feed URLs in our system. If your site is serving content over HTTPS, we will update the indexed URLs for your RSS feeds. We suggest doing a spotcheck to confirm that all feeds have been updated. Note: check to make sure that the URLs listed <em>within</em> the RSS feed are also HTTPS. If you need a bulk update done after December, please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Display:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Image Assets:</strong> Update the Favicon URL.</li>
  <li><strong>Header &amp; Footer:</strong> Update header and footer links.</li>
  <li><strong>No Results Page:</strong> Update alternative links.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="only-those-using-domains--advanced-features">Only those using <code>Domains &gt; Advanced</code> features:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Supplemental Feed:</strong> Throughout December 2016, we are doing bulk updates of RSS feed URLs in our system. If your site is serving content over HTTPS, we will update the indexed URLs for your RSS feeds. We suggest doing a spotcheck to confirm that all feeds have been updated. Note: check to make sure that the URLs listed <em>within</em> the RSS feed are also HTTPS. If you need a bulk update done after December, please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Supplemental URLs:</strong> Throughout December 2016, we are doing bulk updates of supplemental URLs in our system. If your site is serving content over HTTPS, we will update the supplemental URLs you have submitted. We suggest doing a spotcheck to confirm that all URLs have been updated. If you need a bulk update done after December, please <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Filter URLs:</strong> Update filtered URLs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-masked-domains">2. Masked Domains</h2>

<p>If your site uses <a href="/manual/cname.html">domain masking</a>: <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">contact our team</a> to be added to our SSL certificate. While this step doesn’t apply to everyone, it does need to be done before step 3.</p>

<h2 id="3-form-code-action-on-your-website">3. Form Code Action on Your Website</h2>

<p>Update your form code action: An <code>s</code> must be added to your site’s form action in order for the request to be made over HTTPS, and for the results page to be served over HTTPS. Example:</p>

<p><code>&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"&gt;</code></p>

<h2 id="4-commercial-search-engines">4. Commercial Search Engines</h2>

<p>Notify Google and Bing about the change; Google and Bing treat a migration from HTTP to HTTPS as a site move.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google has a step-by-step guide, <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6033049">Move a Site with URL changes</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Additional SEO best practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update your XML sitemap with HTTPS URLs.</li>
  <li>Use <code>rel canonical</code> to <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en#https">declare HTTPS the preferred version</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>Update internal website links.</li>
  <li>Update links to your website from social media and other platforms managed by your agency.</li>

    <link href="https://search.gov/blog/serp-redesign-tips.html"/>
    <updated>2016-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/serp-redesign-tips.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you customize the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned results page</a> to match your site’s <a href="/manual/brand.html">brand</a>, we thought it’d be good to highlight some of our favorite tips.</p>

<h2 id="display-overview">Display Overview</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Display &gt; Display Overview</p>

<p>Shorter display names look best for the faceted search and related sites. Try to keep names under 15 characters.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=visas">USA.gov</a> has multiple faceted topics, and a related site for Spanish.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fonts--colors">Fonts &amp; Colors</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Display &gt; Fonts &amp; Colors</p>

<p>Use a background color on the header, page body, or both. For best results, use different colors for the header and body.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your background doesn’t have to be a strong color. A light gray can provide subtle definition as seen on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=nih&amp;query=library">NIH.gov</a>.</li>
  <li>A good, strong color for the search button can go a long way, as seen <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?&amp;affiliate=kidsgov&amp;query=washington">Kids.gov</a>.</li>
  <li>Especially buttons with a contrasting accent color like on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=gold&amp;affiliate=treasurydirect">TreasuryDirect</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="image-assets">Image Assets</h2>

<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Display &gt; Image Assets</p>

<p>A logo that has both the seal and agency name can provide a stronger identity than a seal only or a name only.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; YourSite &gt; Manage Content &gt; Best Bets: Graphics</p>

<p>Do you want to promote a specific web page or collection of web pages? Create a Graphics Best Bet.</p>

<p>A best bet appears above the standard web results when a searcher’s query matches the text of its title, description, or keywords.</p>

<p>Graphics best bets have a one or two-column layout and you can add an image. The most relevant best bet is listed under a heading, Recommended by YourSite.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows a text best bet displayed on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usgs&amp;query=tsunamis">USGS.gov for a search on tsunamis</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usgs&amp;query=tsunamis"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/best-bets-graphics.png" alt="Graphics best bet highlighting tsunami links on USGS.gov" title="Graphics best bet highlighting tsunami links on USGS.gov" /></a></p>

<p>There are a variety of layouts possible for graphics best bets.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Two columns with a collection of links and an image</strong> displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em><a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?query=wildfires&amp;affiliate=usagov">wildfires</a></em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Two columns with a collection of links only</strong> displayed on USA.gov for a search on <em><a href="https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=housing">housing</a></em>.</li>
  <li><strong>One column with a link to a specific web page and an image</strong> displayed on WhiteHouse.gov for a search on <em><a href="https://search.whitehouse.gov/search?affiliate=wh&amp;query=jobs">jobs</a></em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-a-graphics-best-bet">Add a Graphics Best Bet</h2>

<p><strong><em>Title.</em></strong> Add the title (up to 255 characters) of the web page or collection of web pages that you want to promote. The title is visible to searchers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Title URL.</em></strong> Add the URL of the primary web page that you want to promote. This field is optional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Status and Publish Dates.</em></strong> The default start date is the day on which you create the best bet. The default end date is null, so it will stay up forever until you decide to take it down. You can opt to set a start and end date to control to specify other start and end dates. You can also opt to set its status as either active or inactive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Layout.</em></strong> Select a one- or two-column layout.</p>

<p><strong><em>Image.</em></strong> You can opt to add an image.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keywords.</em></strong> Keywords are optional and they’re <em>not</em> visible to searchers. Add specific words or phrases that aren’t already included in the visible title or link titles. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field.</p>

<p><strong><em>Links.</em></strong> Enter a title and URL for each link. There is no limit on the number of links. Use the three horizontal bars on the left to rearrange the display order of the links. If you select a two-column layout above, links are displayed in newspaper-style format, with an automatic break for columns depending on how many links you list. The link titles are visible to searchers.</p>

<h2 id="when-searchers-see-your-best-bets">When Searchers See Your Best Bets</h2>

<p>For searchers to see a best bet on your site, it must match their query and be relevant and active.</p>

<h3 id="it-matches-their-query">It Matches Their Query</h3>

<p>Searchers see your best bets when their query:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Matches any or all words in the title,</li>
  <li>Matches any of all words in the link titles, or</li>
  <li>Matches a keyword exactly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Matches are made within, but not across, fields.</p>

<p>A sample best bet entry is below.</p>

<pre><code>Title: Estate Tax  
Link title 1: Transfer Property After You Pass Away  
Link title 2: Estate Tax Rights  
Link title 3: Tax Rates  
Keyword 1: death tax  
Keyword 2: inheritance tax  
Keyword 3: fair market value  
Keyword 4: market value  
</code></pre>

<p>This best bet would display for searches on estate tax (exact title match), estate (partial title match), tax on the estate (title match that includes stopwords), estate taxes (title match for singular/plural variant), property tax (partial link title match), propertey tax (link title match with a slight misspelling), and death tax (exact keyword match), among other queries.</p>

<p>It would <em>not</em> display for searches on death, death property, taxes after death, fair value, or estate property tax as they’re only partial keyword or cross field matches.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-very-relevant">It Is Very Relevant</h3>

<p>After we determine best bets match the searcher’s query, we determine their relevance and display only the most relevant best bet. Relevance is determined, in order, first by title, then by link titles, and lastly by keywords. Date is used as a tiebreaker if the entries’ scores based on the above three factors are equal.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-active">It Is Active</h3>

<p>We use <a href="/manual/color-codes.html">color coding</a> to indicate each entry’s status.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Color</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Green   </td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Active         </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Yellow</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Inactive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"> </td>
      <td style="text-align: left"> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Active best bets are shown to searchers on your site. Inactive entries aren’t shown to searchers because they’re inactive, expired (by the publish end date), or both.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlighted-features">Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="javascript-search-results-page">JavaScript Search Results Page</h3>

<p>Our new JavaScript search results page was released in Beta. This new results page platform allows us to offer more layout options, to better complement our customers’ site layouts. The first layout released matches the current default layout.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/new-serp-classic-template.png" alt="New JavaScript results page" width="100%" /></p>

<h3 id="crawling-and-indexing">Crawling and Indexing</h3>

<p>We are exploring how we can use our own crawler for a subset of our customers’ search configurations. The goal is to serve more results directly from our own indexes, rather than leveraging commercial indexes. We recognize that not all agency customers are able to send us their content via API or RSS, and we also recognize that agencies are interested in having more control over when their content gets indexed, which is not possible with the commercial crawlers.</p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In August, our development team successfully migrated Search’s infrastructure to AWS. We continue to make updates to the new environment, including ClamAV scanning and new VPCs. Other work around our ATO includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Nessus scanner work</li>
      <li>Re-IP’ing our system to integrate with GSA’s new log archiving system</li>
      <li>Password management and handling updates, now requiring complex passwords, updates every 90 days, and displaying ambiguous login error messages.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We continue to assist customers with <a href="/manual/https-transition.html">transitioning to HTTPS</a>, adding <a href="/manual/cname.html">sites’ domain masks</a> to our SSL certificate and preparing to update our help manual and some backend configurations.</li>
  <li>When you <a href="/manual/clone-site.html">clone a search configuration</a>, your type-ahead suggestions will no longer clone to the new configuration. This enables your new site to populate type-ahead suggestions based on its own traffic.</li>
  <li>In December, Bing is <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bingdevcenter/2016/11/04/azure-data-market-bing-search-and-web-results-only-apis-to-be-decommissioned-december-15/">deprecating 2 of its APIs</a>. We’re handling this transition for all search configurations that use our hosted search results page. We began preparing for the transition this month and will complete work prior to the December 15th deprecation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Email verification links were redirecting infinitely, causing some new users to be unable to get into the system.</li>
  <li>We fixed a conflict for our customers who may share machines with other users, so now if a user is logged in and another user attempts to verify their account, the original user will be logged out so the second user can complete their verification.</li>

<p>The Referrers report shows what pages searchers were on when they entered their queries. The current month is shown by default, and the date can be adjusted by using the date selectors at the top of the page and re-generating the report.</p>

<p>You can also toggle between filtered and unfiltered views of the data by clicking on the filter icon (<i class="icon-filter"></i>) in the top navigation bar. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site’s visitors. The unfiltered data include nearly all searches and clicks. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded.</p>

<p>Data are available in the Admin Center from the past 13 months.</p>

<h2 id="top-referrers">Top Referrers</h2>

<p>The top 1,000 most popular referring URLs for your selected time period, with the most popular listed first.</p>

<h2 id="-of-queries"># of Queries</h2>

<p>The number of queries made from a specific referring URL.</p>

<p>Click on the link to see a list of all the queries  that were made from a specific URL, with the most popular listed first (the <strong>Queries from a Referring URL</strong> report). You can see the number of times each query was made from that URL.

<p>The clone site feature allows you to create an identical copy of your current search configuration. All settings are carried over to the cloned site, except for images you may have uploaded for <a href="/manual/best-bets.html#bbg">Graphics Best Bets</a>.</p>

<p>Any users of your current configuration will have access to the cloned site.</p>

<p>The default site handle for the cloned site will be <code>OriginalSiteHandle_copy</code>. You will need to update this default name before hitting submit.</p>

<p>Your site handle is a unique identifier for your site. The site handle is included in the request you send us from your search box, to let us know which search site to use. We also include it in the URL of your search results page, again, to show which search site is being used. We recommend making this handle short and unique, such as <code>nih</code>.</p>

<p>Handles can have lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores only. They can’t have spaces and other punctuation.</p>

<p>If you’d like to edit your site handle after the fact, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a>. Note, however, that you will lose access to any search analytics that were collected using the old site handle.</p>

<p>To customize your search results page and match your site’s brand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define your color scheme on the Fonts &amp; Colors page.</li>
  <li>Upload your logo on the Image Assets page. (We’ll also link your logo to your homepage using the homepage URL you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page.)</li>
  <li>Add your navigation links on the Header &amp; Footer page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Read our <a href="/blog/serp-redesign-tips.html">favorite tips</a> to see how other sites have customized their results pages and for some ideas on how to optimize the <a href="/blog/serp-redesign.html">newly redesigned results page</a> for your site.</p>

<h2 id="font--colors">Font &amp; Colors</h2>

<p><strong>Font Family.</strong> Leave the default font as-is, or select your preferred font family.</p>

<p><strong>Color Scheme.</strong> Leave the default color scheme as-is, or select Custom to create a customized scheme. Customize the color of any page element by clicking on it and entering a valid three- or six-digit hex value. You can also pick a color by dragging your mouse inside the color picker window.</p>

<h2 id="image-assets">Image Assets</h2>

<p><strong>Favicon.</strong> Provide the URL for your agency’s favicon. (A <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/favicon/f/blfaqfavicon1.htm">favicon</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, short for favorites icon, is the small image associated with your website.)</p>

<p><strong>Logo.</strong> Use the Choose File option to upload the logo that you’d like to appear in the header of your results page. Click on the option, Mark Logo for Deletion, to delete an uploaded logo. There isn’t a required dimension. That said, images less than 550 pixels wide and 100 pixels high tend to work best.</p>

<p>If you don’t upload a logo, searchers will simply see the header, <em>Your Site Name</em>. We’ll use the site name you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Logo Alignment.</strong> Leave the logo center-aligned, or select Left to make it left-aligned or Right to make it right-aligned. (Right-aligned logos are typically used on sites with right-to-left <a href="/manual/settings.html">languages</a> like Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu.)</p>

<p><strong>Logo Alt Text.</strong> Add alt text for your logo. If you don’t add custom alt text, we’ll use the site name you provide on the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> page as the default alt text.</p>

<h2 id="header--footer">Header &amp; Footer</h2>

<p><strong>Tagline.</strong> Fill out text for a “tagline” if you’d like one to appear at the very top of your results page header.</p>

<p>The default tagline style uses Georgia (font family), 1.3 em (size), and italic (style). Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> if you’d like to change the default font family, size, or style.</p>

<p><strong>Menu Button Alignment.</strong> Leave the Browse Site “hamburger” menu right-aligned, or select the Left option to make it left-aligned.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/power-users-recap.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our April 2015 training session looked into the nooks and crannies of the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>, and provided other advanced tips for optimizing your search. We used the scenario of a site redesign to ground these tips in a common experience. This is a summary and cheat sheet. Since we know that some of these tips won’t be relevant until they’re relevant, please hang on to this for future reference.</p>

<p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Eg9LhhFcY">recorded session</a> on YouTube.</p>

<p>The launch of a new or redesigned site is a great time to think about refreshing your search as well. Come along on a journey through a search refresh before, during, and just after your new site goes live. You need not wait for a new site, though - these steps can be taken at any time.</p>

<h2 id="tell-search-engines-to-re-index-your-site">Tell Search Engines to (Re-)Index Your Site</h2>

<p>DigitalGov Search does not crawl. Crawling is hard and expensive, and others have systems in place that do this very well, so we rely on commercial search engines’ indexes of your site. Search engines create <strong>indexes</strong> of the websites they crawl, and search queries are run against those indexes. If a website is restructured but the search indexes are not updated, the old structure will be presented in search results.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Robots.txt</strong> files declare what can and cannot be indexed by crawlers. Tip: Set up a robots.txt file on your <em>beta</em> site to <em>disallow</em> indexing. When you switch your beta site to <strong>production</strong>, update the robots.txt to <strong>allow</strong> indexing. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=robots.txt+example">Resources and Examples</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>
    <ul>
      <li>Put your file at the root of your site, <code>http://www.YOURSITE.gov/robots.txt</code>.</li>
      <li>If you didn’t disallow indexing of your beta site and it has already been indexed, request it be removed via Google and Bing’s webmaster tools sites. A robots.txt file won’t proactively <em>remove</em> content from search engines’ indexes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>301 redirects</strong> allow crawlers to find their way around your new structure, and expedite the reindexing process. A 404 page is a dead end, and the new location or version of that file can’t be found from there.
    <ul>
      <li>If the volume of 301s to place is daunting, consider setting a general 301 for all the content in a location pointing to the new index page for that type of content. You can also prioritize your 301 placement based on your site usage analytics, starting with the most popular pages.</li>
      <li>If you’re not sure which of your pages are throwing 404s, you can run your list of URLs through an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=http+status+checker">online http status checker</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, or you could install SEO auditing software on your computer, if your IT policies allow it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>XML sitemaps</strong> tell crawlers how often to reindex your site, or portions of your site. The protocol and examples are available at [Sitemaps.org(http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. The crucial element is to set the <code>&lt;changefreq&gt;</code> tag to the appropriate frequency for your content. You can set the frequency at the site, folder, or even individual item level.
    <ul>
      <li>Put your file at the root of your site, <code>http://www.YOURSITE.gov/sitemap.xml</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See also our <a href="https://search.gov/manual/redesign.html">tips on preparing for a site redesign</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="direct"></a></p>
<h2 id="and-tell-us-about-your-content-and-well-index-it-directly">And, Tell Us about Your Content and We’ll Index It Directly</h2>

<p>While we don’t crawl, we will index any pages you tell us about. The steps mentioned above will be useful for searchers out on the web looking for your information and services. By default we leverage the commercial indexes for your site search, but we have our own indexes as well.  If you’re having a hard time getting search engines to index your new site, re-index your old site, or you just prefer our indexes, there are a couple of ways you can tell us about your content.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can <a href="https://search.gov/manual/rss.html"><strong>send us all of your content</strong> via RSS</a> for direct indexing. We’ll need the URL, title, description, update date, and the full content or body of each item. Sort by update date in descending order. This can be an RSS or Atom feed. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Let us know</a> you created this feed. There are a few different options for indexing feeds so we’ll make sure it’s set up in the best way possible.</li>
  <li>Better yet, <strong>publish your content via API</strong>. We are in the beginning stages of development for a bootstrap API and a CRUD API. If you’d like to be part of our beta testing group and give feedback on the product, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">let us know</a>. We want to get people kicking the tires on the prototype early, in the coming weeks. (note, this is current as of April 2015)</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="ac"></a></p>
<h2 id="update-your-search-settings-in-the-admin-center">Update Your Search Settings in the Admin Center</h2>

<p>Don’t forget to update your content settings in the Admin Center to point to your new content. This is an important, but often overlooked step.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up your domains list to <strong>include entire domains</strong>. Example: nih.gov - not www.nih.gov. Specifying www will limit your search to that particular subdomain. If you do specify a subdomain, do so with the intent to limit your search. <a href="/index.html">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; <code>YourSite</code> &gt; <code>Content</code> &gt; <code>Domains</code></li>
  <li>If a particular <strong>new item</strong> is not showing up in search results and you need it there ASAP, you can create a Best Bet pointing to it, or add it as a Supplemental URL.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Best Bets</strong> can be managed at <a href="https://search.gov">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; <code>YourSite</code> &gt; <code>Content</code> &gt; <code>Best Bets: Text or Best Bets: Graphics</code> <em>(Recommended)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Supplemental URLs</strong> can be added at <a href="https://search.gov">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; <code>YourSite</code> &gt; <code>Content</code> &gt; <code>Domains</code> &gt; <code>Advanced</code> &gt; <code>Supplemental URLs</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When undergoing a <a href="https://search.gov/manual/redesign.html">site redesign</a>, be sure to <strong>update</strong> Collections, Best Bets, RSS Feeds, Header and Footer links, related sites, image assets, and results page colors, as appropriate.</li>
  <li>If you set up a <strong>test search site</strong> to go with your beta site, we recommend you <strong>transfer</strong> all the new settings over to your old site when you take your beta site into production, in order to maintain continuity of analytics. The test search site will have separate analytics from your existing, live search. If you would like help transferring your settings, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">let us know</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="emergency"></a></p>
<h2 id="break-glass-in-case-of-emergency">Break Glass In Case of Emergency</h2>

<p>We have a stopgap measure available to <a href="https://search.gov/manual/domains-advanced.html">filter certain results</a> directly in the Admin Center. Under <code>[Search.gov Home](https://search.gov) &gt; [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) &gt; YourSite &gt; Analytics &gt; Queries</code> you’ll see an option for Filter URLs.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note!</strong> This is meant to be a <strong>stopgap measure</strong> until search engines’ indexes have caught up. After they’re updated there, the urls you’ve filtered here <strong>should be removed</strong>. They are appended to your query and are counted against the byte limit we can include in any one query. Please don’t forget to remove them after you no longer need them.</p>

<p><a name="fancy"></a></p>
<h2 id="get-fancy">Get Fancy</h2>

<p>At any time, you can use some of our more advanced options to get the most out of your search. Don’t wait for a redesign to take advantage of these features.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3rd party tracking</strong> allows you to include search traffic in your broader website and customer experience monitoring, such as Google Analytics and Foresee.
    <ul>
      <li>If you are sending <strong>more than one code</strong>, or an additional code, for a given tracking service, please either send both together in the same submission, or include a note with your second code snippet that it should be appended to what you had submitted before.</li>
      <li><strong>ForeSee</strong> requires you set up a <a href="https://search.gov/manual/cname.html">cname</a> in order for it to work (see below).</li>
      <li>You can also put in any other analytics or customer satisfaction tools you use.</li>
      <li>The <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> is already integrated with DigitalGov Search, so you don’t need to do anything.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Domain Masking</strong> is available for your hosted search results page. Create a <strong>CNAME</strong> record in your external DNS records. Example: <code>NAME: search.YOURSITE.gov</code> ; <code>CNAME: search.usa.gov.edgekey.net</code>. Other subdomain options are ‘find’ and ‘findit.’ <strong>Alert us in writing</strong> of your choice and we’ll get our side set up. When both sides are ready, <strong>update the form code</strong> on your search box to point to <code>search.YOURSITE.gov</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Search box setup</strong>. You can get fancy with your search box, pointing it to a particular collection, or adding options for people to set their search scope.
    <ul>
      <li>Start your <strong>search in a collection</strong>: add <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="INSERT_COLLECTION_ID_#" /&gt;</code> to your form code. The collection ID can be found in the URL of the collection’s edit screen.</li>
      <li>Create an <strong>isolated search</strong> experience by searching a hidden collection: add <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="dc" value="INSERT_COLLECTION_ID_#" /&gt;</code>, as above, but make sure the collection display is set to OFF.</li>
      <li>Provide <strong>options</strong> that allow the user to set their search scope from the get-go. For example, <a href="http://lawrenceks.org/">Lawrence, Kansas</a> has developed a nice modern approach to radio buttons.</li>
      <li>Pass a <strong>site limit parameter</strong> from your search box: add <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="sitelimit" id="sitelimit" value="www.agency.gov/limittothisfolder"&gt;</code> to your form code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>API key</strong> for displaying search results on your own site is available under <a href="https://search.gov">Search.gov Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; <code>YourSite</code> &gt; <code>Activate</code> &gt; <code>API Access Key</code>. We recommend you <strong>use the hosted results page</strong> whenever possible, to take advantage of all of the features of our service.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2-highlighted-features">2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="1-tools-for-filtering-results">1. Tools for Filtering Results</h3>

<p>The display of search results pages is constantly evolving. Some changes are subtle. Others are more noticeable.</p>

<p>In line with industry best practices and commercial search engines, we’ve moved the tools for filtering and sorting results to the top of results list (rather than on the left side). We’ve also added an option to clear all filters.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/search-tools.png" alt="Tools for filtering and sorting" /></p>

<h3 id="2-access-your-raw-logs">2. Access Your Raw Logs</h3>

<p>You can now access your raw HTTP logs. These logs contain valuable data on searches, clicks and discovery tag page loads.</p>

<p>Read <em>How to Access Your Raw Logs</em> for more details about how to request secure FTP access to your logs.</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Searchers now see the most current titles and descriptions available for <a href="/manual/youtube.html">YouTube videos</a> and they won’t see any deleted videos.</li>
  <li>Visitors to the pages search.usa.gov and buscador.usa.gov are now automatically redirected to <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa">GobiernoUSA.gov</a>, respectively, so they see the most recent content on these homepages.</li>
  <li>Spanish searchers now see <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov">plain language</a> helper text.</li>
  <li>Searchers no longer see two search boxes on the search results page, which will create a more visually appealing and usable page.</li>
  <li>We open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls Server API</a> in Github.</li>
  <li>Searchers are now able to search and see results from collections that are not visible in the left-hand navigation on your “main” web results. You can use this option to provide a search box on a small subset of content (such as a policy manual or meeting minutes) while not cluttering up the left-hand navigation on your main results page. (It also helps reduce the likelihood that searchers experience a “dead end” on your main results page.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We rewrote some query routing rules for job searches to present more precise results in the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a>.</li>
  <li>We configured <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a> to enable continuous integration for the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls Server API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs Server API</a>.</li>
  <li>We shortened the Jobs API base URL to <code>https://api.usa.gov/jobs/search</code>.</li>
  <li>We reconfigured our RSS feed fetching to update more efficiently.</li>
  <li>We upgraded to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/11/SEC-ANN-Rails-3-2-12-3-1-11-and-2-3-17-have-been-released">Rails 3.2.12</a> and <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rack">Rack</a> 1.4.5.</li>

  <li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> 6.3.</li>
  <li>We optimized the routing of search queries so that they’re served by the geographically closest datacenter.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="federal-register-documents-are-now-available">Federal Register Documents Are Now Available</h2>

<p>Federal agencies publish notices, proposed rules, and final rules in the <em><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">Federal Register</a></em>. To make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in government decision-making, we created the <em>Federal Register</em> module to help searchers find these notices and rules.</p>

<p>This GovBox offers direct access to <em>Federal Register</em> documents. We pull the data from the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers">Federal Register API</a> to provide timely information across all documents.</p>

<p>If you <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">opt to show the Federal Register</a> module, searchers looking for topics on your site can readily find the notices and rules that your agency has published in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<p>The full title will be shown within the search results and when <em>Federal Register</em> documents have been posted by multiple agencies, searchers will see both agencies listed.</p>

<p>Documents with open comment periods will appear before relevant documents with closed comment periods. The status of the comment period will be noted in the results. At the bottom of the page, there is a link to see more <em>Federal Register</em> documents.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Federal agencies publish notices, proposed rules, and final rules in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov"><em>Federal Register</em></a>. To make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in government decision-making, we created the <em>Federal Register</em> module to help searchers find these notices and rules.</p>

<p>This module offers direct access to <em>Federal Register</em> documents. We pull the data from the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers">Federal Register API</a> to provide timely information across all documents.</p>

<p>If you <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">opt to show the Federal Register</a> module, searchers on your site can readily find the notices and rules that your agency has published in the <em>Federal Register</em>, as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search?affiliate=nih&amp;query=autoimmune+diseases"><em>autoimmune diseases</em> on NIH.gov</a>.</p>

<p>To help searchers more easily find what they’re looking for, you can now promote related content by listing it as a set of value-added links under your organic web results. See the sample results page below that shows value-added links for EDGAR filings for a search on <em>apple</em> on SEC.gov.</p>

<p>Do you have related content that you’d like to display as value-added links that searchers should see within the context of each other (such as related forms, instructions, and publications)? If your related content follows a discernable URL pattern, email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> and we’ll work with you to promote the related content on your site.</p>

<p>We’ve open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator">code for the sitelink generator</a> on Github so you can <a href="https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator/fork">fork the code</a> and contribute to it directly.

    <link href="https://search.gov/blog/open-source.html"/>
    <updated>2014-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/open-source.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We keep an eye on on our what our government counterparts are up to, both in the U.S. and other countries. We first came across <a href="https://www.gov.uk">Gov.UK’s</a> philosophy on and approach to <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open">coding in the open</a> a couple of years ago. It caught our attention and we realized we should also articulate our open source strategy.</p>

<h2 id="use-and-contribute-to-open-source-projects">Use and Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>Since 2010, we’ve embraced and leveraged open source software to build our site search service for federal, state, and local government websites. This use of open source has allowed us to experience enormous growth over the past few years. In July 2014 alone, over 23 million searchers received results from our service—a five-fold increase since July 2010.</p>

<p>Our search service is now a complex system made up of many moving parts, including providing type-ahead search suggestions, serving search results, fetching, indexing, and caching content, and providing analytics.</p>

<p>Each of these parts is compiled into our codebase and, as we use open source components for our system, we contribute back to the projects.</p>

<h2 id="code-in-the-open">Code in the Open</h2>

<p>We recently began to unravel our monolithic codebase so that we can share individual pieces of our code. To borrow the phrase from Gov.UK, we’re now <strong><em>coding in the open</em></strong>.</p>

<p>We recently released the code for our <a href="https://github.com/gsa/oasis">social media image</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">jobs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">recalls</a> API servers. They’re our first foray into coding in the open. The source code for these API servers is in <a href="https://github.com/GSA">our GitHub repo</a> and is available for anyone to see and contribute to.</p>

<p>The data products for the jobs and recalls code are also open and available for anyone to consume on our <a href="/developer/index.html">Developer hub</a>.</p>

<p>These three servers and their underlying data now operate outside of our core search codebase.</p>

<p>Following this same model, moving forward, we plan to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share first—For every new feature, we’ll write the code so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the code, not just us. If the public community contributes to the codebase, we’ll be able to improve this feature without taxing our developers.</li>
  <li>Expose APIs—We’ll expose our data products as APIs so that <em>anyone</em> can make use of the data, not just searchers on a government websites.</li>
  <li>Be our own customer—We’ll use our own public code and data just like everyone else. We’ll call our own API servers to integrate the data within our search results pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="make-things-open-to-make-things-better">Make Things Open to Make Things Better</h2>

<p>We agree with Gov.UK that “to make things open makes things better.”</p>

<p>We have finite resources and we don’t want to lose our focus on serving our agency customers and improving visitors’ search experience on government websites. So, we won’t be spending a lot of time to build or support a vibrant community around our code.</p>

<p>That said, we hope that exposing the pieces of our system will be useful to someone somewhere. We’ll continue to provide the “ingredients” of our search service so that others will be able to make use of the code and data in ways that we could never imagine.</p>

<h2 id="and-were-not-alone">And, We’re Not Alone</h2>

<p>We’re not alone. Other federal agencies have embraced the approach of coding in the open and have <a href="http://gsa.github.io/federal-open-source-repos">GitHub repos</a>. Below are a just a few of our many favorites.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.cfpb.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> has embraced open source, including serving their public data sets through <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/qu">qu</a> and sharing their work at <a href="http://cfpb.github.io">http://cfpb.github.io</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> recently made public FDA datasets more accessible at <a href="https://open.fda.gov">openFDA</a>.</li>
  <li>GSA’s newly-created <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a> has committed to <a href="http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/93415834296/working-in-public-from-day-1">working in the open from day 1</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> was in the forefront of using open source software in the federal government with their use of Drupal. They’re continuing to lead by example by opening up the code for their <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions">We the People petitions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/wh-app-android">Android</a> mobile apps.</li>

    <updated>2014-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/june-2014.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlighted-features">Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="feature-1-we-incorporated-your-feedback-into-our-redesigned-results-page">Feature 1. We incorporated your feedback into our redesigned results page.</h3>

<p>We’re continuing to work on our redesigned search results page to incorporate your feedback. Searchers now see a more prominent option to browse your site.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=federalstudentaid"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/release-06-2014-fedaid-browse.png" alt="Redesigned option to browse site" title="Redesigned option to browse site" /></a></p>

<p>Additionally, you can now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Left align your logo;</li>
  <li>Add a direct link to your advanced search page (using the syntax http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=<a href="/manual/settings.html">YourSiteHandle</a>); and</li>
  <li>Display images from <a href="/manual/rss.html">media RSS feeds</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All job openings (beyond those for U.S. citizens only) now appear when searchers click on the link to see all the openings on <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USAJobs</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=jobs"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/release-06-2014-USAgov.png" alt="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov results page" title="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov  results page" /></a></p>

<h3 id="feature-2-you-can-access-real-time-unfiltered-analytics">Feature 2. You can access real-time, unfiltered analytics.</h3>

<p>We recently upgraded our underlying analytics framework to use the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/">ELK stack</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. We’ve gained many benefits with the upgrade. There are also two big benefits for you.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit #1: Real-time Data.</strong> You can now instantaneously see the searches and clicks that are performed on your site. We previously processed some of your analytics via nightly cron jobs so there was a delay before you saw the data. Try it out. Do a search on your site and then go to <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. You’ll see your search query on the dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit #2: Unfiltered Data.</strong> You can now access your unfiltered analytics via the Admin Center so you can more easily manipulate the data. We previously only provided unfiltered data in the CSV downloads or via secure FTP.</p>

<p>You still see filtered data by default. You can toggle between a filtered or unfiltered view by going to the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> &gt; Analytics &gt; Settings.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Filtered.</em> Several rules are applied to remove bot and other non-human looking traffic. The filtered data represent our best effort to show you real searches performed by your site’s visitors.</li>
  <li><em>Unfiltered.</em> Nearly all searches and clicks are included. Only known spiders (such as Bingbot and Googlebot) are excluded. Some of you may see dramatically more data in the unfiltered view.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/release-04-2014-Analytics.png" alt="Toggle between a filtered or unfiltered view" title="Toggle between a filtered or unfiltered view" /></a></p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We now diplay images from Flickr only by default. <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">Email us</a> if you’d like to display images from Bing, too.</li>
  <li>We now <a href="http://code.flickr.net/2014/04/30/flickr-api-going-ssl-only-on-june-27th-2014/">use SSL to access the Flickr API</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/elasticsearch-1-2-1-released/">ElasticSearch 1.2.1</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>We now handle some error messages from the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> more gracefully.</li>
  <li>We added agency IDs from the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">Federal Register</a> to our database in preparation for using <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers">their API</a> to display Federal Register documents in our search results.</li>
  <li>As we now have a single, responsive search results page, we no longer use ‘Mobile Logo’ in the Admin Center. We now use just ‘Logo.’</li>
  <li>We removed the fields for image attribution for <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Graphics Best Bets</a> from our database.</li>
  <li>We updated our cron-based emails to use our new analytics framework.</li>
  <li>We backfilled the data in our Admin Center so that you see analytics from 13 months ago.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed our parser for <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> RSS feeds to use atom:summary when atom:content isn’t present.</li>
  <li>We fixed a bug so that the options to filter search results now appears in Internet Explorer 8.</li>
  <li>We now use a <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/method-reference#named">named tracker</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> so that, when you use the default tracker, you can see pageviews and other data in your Google Analytics accounts.</li>

    <link href="https://search.gov/releases/may-2014.html"/>
    <updated>2014-07-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/may-2014.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>We officially rolled our newly <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/serp-redesign.html">redesigned results page</a>.</p>

<p>As we continue to add features to our search results page, you can see small, incremental changes. We added a thin, visible border around the search box to improve its visibility, especially against a white background. We changed the color of the query term in the search box from gray to black. We also added more padding around <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">Best Bets</a> so that searchers can more readily distinguish them from web results. At the bottom of page, we added “Page 1” to “Next »” to more clearly indicate that more results are available.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=huricane"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/release-05-2014-usa-huricane.png" alt="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov results page" title="Tweaks to the redesigned USA.gov results page" /></a></p>

<p>Additionally, searchers can now see image and video results. Searchers can filter results to images or videos only. They can also see up to one inline video result with a link to see more videos.</p>

<p>To improve the quality of the image search results, we now display images from <a href="/manual/flickr.html">your Flickr photostream</a> by default.</p>

<p>We realized that our results page was getting a bit top-heavy so we now display inline results only when they’re most relevant—capping the display of inline videos at 13 months and inline RSS-based news results at four months. Additionally, we display very recent news results (less than five days) at the top of the page and less recent news results closer to the bottom.</p>

<p>It is also now possible to include an email address as a header or footer link by using mailto:info@agency.gov within the URL.</p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We added support for .com <a href="/manual/cname.html">CNAMEs</a>.</li>
  <li>We increased the maximum mobile logo size from 50KB to 64KB.</li>
  <li>We updated <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to use <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby 2.0</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>We added robots.txt files to all sites that use a CNAME to block crawlers from their search results pages.</li>
  <li>We updated <a href="http://logstash.net/">logstash</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> and upgraded <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/downloads/1-2-0/">ElasticSearch to 1.2.0</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>We investigated <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> modules that publish content APIs for our bring your own index pilot.</li>
  <li>We updated our SSL certificate.</li>
  <li>We added a page in the Admin Center for you to let us know about your <a href="/manual/instagram.html">Instagram</a> account. We also registered for the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. (We’re planning to display image results Instagram soon.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Searchers no longer see duplicate video results.</li>
  <li>We fixed the spacing between web results on mobile phones.</li>
  <li>We now automatically populate the homepage URL for newly added sites.</li>

<p>The last time we did a major redesign of our results page was in January 2012. It was long overdue for a facelift.</p>

<p>So, we’ve redesigned our search results page. We’ve kept an eye on best practices in the search industry and what media websites (like NPR.org and NYTimes.com) are up to, But, we’re not simply following the leaders. We’ve also <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/07/analyzing-search-data-in-real-time-to-drive-decisions/">analyzed our search data</a> to make data-driven decisions that, ultimately, aim to improve searchers’ experience on your site.</p>

<p>Below are some of the highlights.</p>

<h2 id="basic-search-results">Basic Search Results</h2>

<p>We started with the basic search results because they’re the meat of the page. They also have the highest clickthru rate among the various items shown on the page. Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>passport</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-search-result.png" alt="Search result for passport on USA.gov" title="Search result for passport on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>We’ve done away with the underlining on the title. The snippet is wider and has more space. Clicking or touching anywhere on the snippet (not just the title) opens the link.</p>

<h2 id="spelling-suggestions">Spelling Suggestions</h2>

<p>Spelling suggestions have the second highest clickthru rate so we focused on those next. Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>manual noriega</em> (sic) on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-spelling.png" alt="Spelling suggestion for manual noriega (sic) on USA.gov" title="Spelling suggestion for manual noriega (sic) on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>We’ve done away with the wordiness and boldface. The suggestion and its corresponding option to override the automatic correction now use plain language and are shown on two lines. We now only use boldface to highlight keyword matches for searchers’ queries.</p>

<h2 id="search-verticals">Search Verticals</h2>

<p>Through <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/digitalgov-user-experience-program/digitalgov-user-experience-program-test-support/">usability tests</a>, we found that searchers didn’t see the options to change the scope of their results in the left-hand column. Data also supports this finding as very, very few searchers clicked on these options. Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>jobs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-verticals.png" alt="Search verticals on USA.gov" title="Search verticals on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new format clusters all options to narrow, broaden, or change the scope of the results together, and places these options directly above the search box. Searchers see up to three options and have the ability to show More …. The old format separated them, showing the option to search on related sites in the right-hand column above the box and verticals in the left-hand column below the box.</p>

<h2 id="site-navigation">Site Navigation</h2>

<p>Once visitors have opted to type a term in the search box, they’re in search mode. Some have already tried and abandoned browsing the website.</p>

<p>To reflect visitors’ shift from browsing to searching, search results pages on many commercial media websites highlight the search verticals and either remove or downplay the site’s navigation. Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>veterans affairs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-navigation.png" alt="Site brand and navigation on USA.gov" title="Site brand and navigation on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new format prominently shows the search verticals above the search box. Searchers can click the logo to return to homepage, or expand the “hamburger” menu to view additional options to browse the site. Searchers can also browse the site using links in the footer.</p>

<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>

<p>Eye tracking studies have shown searchers gravitate to video thumbnails. Snippets are also very important to increase clickthru rates. Searchers are more likely to view a video if they understand how it relates to what they’re looking for. Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>careers</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-video.png" alt="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" title="Video search result for careers on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new video format shows one video plus a clearly labeled “More videos about …” link. It also shows the video’s source (in this case YouTube), the length of the video, and a short snippet. The video is now separated from basic search results by thin grey lines.</p>

<p>Searchers now see inline videos from the past 13 months only. (It used to be forever.) There’s a spike in video views at around one year so this time period allows searchers to see recent inline videos for annual events like tax season, national health observances, and holidays.</p>

<h2 id="news">News</h2>

<p>Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>tornadoes</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-news.png" alt="News search results for tornado on USA.gov" title="News search results for tornado on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new news format now matches the look of the basic search results to provide a more seamless experience.</p>

<p>Searchers now see inline news from the last four months only. (It used to be forever, which showed stale content from several years ago in some cases.) Very recent news (less than five days) shows above the basic search results. Less recent but still timely news (greater than five days and less than four months) shows below the basic search results. The old format always showed news results after the third web result.</p>

<h2 id="tweets">Tweets</h2>

<p>Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>social security</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-tweet.png" alt="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" title="Tweet for social security on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new tweet format shows one tweet inline with the results. It now shows the agency’s Twitter profile image and the tweet is separated from basic search results by thin grey lines and doesn’t have a separate heading. As tweets tend to be very time-sensitive, searchers now see tweets from the last three days only. (It used to be 30 days.) The old format showed tweets in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad.</p>

<h2 id="job-openings">Job Openings</h2>

<p>Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>communications jobs</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-jobs.png" alt="Job results for communications jobs on USA.gov" title="Job results for communications jobs on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new job opening format shows up to three job openings inline with the results. Searchers can now click or touch the down arrow to see up to 10 listings inline. For federal agencies, it now shows the USAJobs logo to clearly identify that as the data source. The job openings are separated from basic search results by thin grey lines. The old format showed jobs in a right-hand column that was often mistaken for an ad and didn’t give searchers the option to see more listings on the results page.</p>

<h2 id="health-topics">Health Topics</h2>

<p>Here’s the before and after for a search on <em>diabetes</em> on USA.gov.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/redesign-health-govbox.png" alt="Health topic result for diabetes on USA.gov" title="Health topic result for diabetes on USA.gov" /></p>

<p>The new health topics format shows a shorter, more concise snippet and the snippet doesn’t have any embedded links. The result now takes up less vertical space as the links for related topics and clinical trials are each listed in a line. The MedlinePlus logo now links to <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="by-government-for-government">By Government, for Government</h2>

<p>Our search results page now ensures the public has a common search experience anywhere, anytime, and on any device. This meets a key objective of the federal government’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html"/>
    <updated>2014-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/hadoop-bigger-ox.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago I rolled my first Hadoop system into production. Since then, I’ve spoken to quite a few people who are eager to try Hadoop themselves in order to solve their own big data problems. Despite having similar backgrounds and data problems, few of these people have sunk their teeth into Hadoop. When I go to Hadoop Meetups in San Francisco, I often meet new people who are evaluating Hadoop and have yet to launch a cluster. Based on my own background and experience, I have some ideas on why this is the case.</p>

<p>I studied computer science in school and have worked on a wide variety of computer systems in my career, with a lot of focus on server-side Java. I learned a bit about building distributed systems and working with large amounts of data when I built a pay-per-click (PPC) ad network in 2004. The system is still in operation and at one point was handling several thousand searches per second. As the sole technical resource on the system, I had to educate myself very quickly about how to scale up.</p>

<p>As I contemplated how doomed I would be should traffic levels increase much more, I remember wondering to myself, “How does Google deal with all that data?” The answer came to me in the form of the Google File System (GFS) paper and later the MapReduce paper, both from Google. It dawned on me that because Google was forced to solve a much larger problem, they had come up with an elegant solution for a whole range of more modest data problems running on commodity hardware. But it wouldn’t be until 2010 that I would get to work with this technology firsthand.</p>

<p>As I wrote in an <a href="/blog/adopting-hadoop.html">earlier article</a>, I started re-architecting DigitalGov Search, the U.S. government’s search system, in 2009 based on a solution stack of free, open source software including Ruby on Rails, Solr, and MySQL. A wave of déja vu hit me as I started worrying about what to do with the growing mountain of data piling up in MySQL and our increasing need to analyze it in different ways. I had heard that a new company called Cloudera, founded by some big data people from Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook, was making Hadoop available for the masses in a reliable distribution, much in the same way that RedHat did for Linux. Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the newly minted <em>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</em> from O’Reilly. The most insightful part of the book to me was the very first sentence. It’s a quote from Grace Hopper: “In pioneer days, they used oxen for heavy pulling, and when one ox couldn’t budge a log, they didn’t try to grow a bigger ox.” I didn’t want to grow a bigger server; I wanted to harness a bunch of small servers together to work in unison. The more I learned the more curious I got, so I started reading more. And that’s when I hit my first roadblock.</p>

<p>I think people who have been working with Hadoop technologies for years and years sometimes forget just how rich and diverse the big data software ecosystem has become, and how daunting it can be to folks approaching it for the first time. When people at the Meetups say they are evaluating solutions to their data scaling problem, the answers they hear sound something like this: “Just use Hadoop Hive Pig Mahout Avro HBase Cassandra Oozie Sqoop Flume ZooKeeper Cascading NoSQL RCFile. Oh, almost forgot…cloud.”</p>

<p>The thought of wading through all of that just to learn about what I needed to learn about was a bit too overwhelming for me, so I put the whole matter aside for a few months. Over time, I started to dive into each of these projects to understand the primary use case, how active the developer community was and which organizations were using it in production. I converged on the idea of using Hive as a warehouse for our data. I opted for Cloudera’s distribution since I wanted to reduce the risk of running into compatibility issues between all the various subsystems. Having tracked down anomalies in a highly multi-threaded and contentious distributed Java system before, I liked the idea of someone else taking on that problem for me.</p>

<p>At some point, I had read everything I could read and grew impatient to get my hands dirty, so I decided to just download CDH3 on my laptop and give it a try. The tutorial instructions for the standalone version worked, and I successfully computed more digits of pi than I ever thought I’d need. After creating some sample data in Hive and running a few queries, I felt pretty confident that Hive would be the right tool for the job. I just needed to find somewhere to install and run HDFS (namenode, secondary namenode, and data nodes), Hadoop (jobtracker and tasktracker nodes), Hive, and Hue for a nice front end to it all.</p>

<p>I knew from my past experience how to stretch the limits of CPU, disk, IO, and memory on commodity servers, and I identified a few potential servers at our primary datacenter with resources I figured I could leverage. Once again I followed the tutorial instructions, this time for the fully distributed version of CDH3, and once again I started to compute pi. And that’s when I hit my second roadblock. It took me a few days to figure out that I had a problem with DNS. Each machine needs to be able to resolve every other machine’s name and IP in the cluster. Whether you do that via /etc/hosts or a local DNS server is up to you, but it needs to happen or the whole thing gets wedged. Once I got that sorted out, everything just started falling into place and I had Hive working in production within a few days. A week later, I started pulling out the MySQL jobs and deleting big tables, and that’s been the trend ever since.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve gone on to learn about using custom Ruby mappers in Hive, moving data back and forth between MySQL and Hive with Sqoop, and getting the data into HDFS in real-time with Flume. All of these components from the Cloudera distribution are working nicely in our production environment now, and I sleep well at night knowing I have such a solid, deliberate plan for growth. My initial investment in learning about the Hadoop ecosystem is really paying dividends, but when I think about all those people at the Meetups stuck in evaluation mode, I feel their pain. Does it have to be such a struggle?</p>

<p>The big challenge in my opinion is not that any one piece of the puzzle is too difficult. Any reasonably smart (or in my case stubborn) engineer can set themselves on the task of learning about a new technology once they know that it needs to be learned. The challenge with the Hadoop ecosystem is that it presents the newbie with the meta-problem of figuring out which of these tools are appropriate for their use case at all, and whether or not to even consider the problem today versus deferring it until later. In a way Facebook has it easy, because when you are adding 15TB of data per day, that decision is pretty much made for you.</p>

<p>For all the companies sitting in the twilight between the gigabyte and the petabyte who don’t have Hadoop expertise in-house, there is a collection of free information to help guide people to the right solution space (Hadoop Tutorial, White Papers). These days, when I talk to people who are evaluating solutions to their big data problems, my advice to them is to break down their problems into a few discrete use cases and then work on ferreting out the technologies that are designed for that use case. Get a proof of concept to demonstrate that the technology can address your use case and convince yourself and others that you’re on the right track. Work toward putting something simple into production. Lather, rinse, and repeat. I am still in that cycle myself, as these days I’m exploring HBase and OpenTSDB to give me low-latency access to time series data and Mahout to do frequent item set mining, but that’s another article for another day.</p>

    <id>https://search.gov/releases/december-2013.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="3-highlighted-features">3 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="feature-1-analyze-searchers-click-behavior">Feature 1. Analyze Searchers’ Click Behavior</h3>

<p>Clickthru rates (CTR) can indicate the relevance of your results for specific search terms. You can now see (a) the CTR for your top 1,000 <a href="/manual/queries.html">queries</a> and (b) your top <a href="/manual/clicks.html">clicked URLs</a>. The data are updated in real time.</p>

<p>Use the data to find searches with low CTRs. For these queries, consider if a low CTR is good or not. (A low CTR can be good when searchers see the answer directly on the results page, eliminating the need to click on a link.) For those that aren’t good, tweak your page’s title or content, add a new page to your site, or add a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bet</a> to point to the relevant page on another agency’s site.</p>

<h3 id="feature-2-analyze-the-terms-that-trigger-best-bets">Feature 2. Analyze the Terms that Trigger Best Bets</h3>

<p>Have you ever wondered what search terms make your <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bets</a> appear? From the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page, you can now drill down to see a pie chart of the terms that trigger each best bet. The data are updated in real time.</p>

<p>Use the data to tweak your best bet’s title, description, and keyword phrases. Or, use it to decide to delete the best bet altogether.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/feature-bb-trigger.png" alt="Pie Chart of Terms Triggering a Best Bet" title="Pie Chart of Terms Triggering a Best Bet" /></p>

<h3 id="feature-3-use-keyword-phrases-to-show-best-bets-only-when-theyre-relevant">Feature 3. Use Keyword Phrases to Show Best Bets Only When They’re Relevant</h3>

<p>Have you ever seen a <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">best bet</a> when you don’t expect it to appear? Best bet keywords are now <em>phrases</em>. This change allows you to show a best bet only when its keyword is an <em>exact match</em> with a searcher’s query.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/feature-improved-phrasing.png" alt="Best Bets Now Use Keyword Phrases" title="Best Bets Now Use Keyword Phrases" /></p>

  <li>We fixed some errors with URL shortening.</li>
  <li>We updated our stemming file so searchers no longer see irrelevant results for intern.</li>
  <li>We replaced Jenkins with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>We fixed a time setting on our API machine.</li>
  <li>We upgraded Java on our API and <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/home.html">Cloudera</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> machines.</li>
</ul>

  <li>We renamed the IP deduped column <i>Real Count (Humans Only)</i> in the downloadable CSV file on the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page.</li>
  <li>We updated our mobile search results page to show a more/less symbol only when it is applicable.</li>
  <li>We fixed the search box on our mobile results page so searchers can easily remove previous queries from the search box and so long mobile search terms don’t overlap with the ‘x’ on the right.</li>
  <li>Best bets now appear even when there are no web results.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="slowness-hurts-web-pages">Slowness Hurts Web Pages</h2>

<p>Have you ever been frustrated when visiting a web page that doesn’t load quickly? Have you ever left a slow web page before it finished loading? You’re not alone.</p>

<p>Several recent studies have quantified customers’ frustration with slow web pages. Customers now  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html">expect results in the blink of an eye</a>. <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> This expection means that your <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/Aberdeen-Library/5136/RA-performance-web-application.aspx">customers are won or lost in one second</a>. <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> A one second delay in loading a web page equals 11% fewer page views, 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and 7% loss in conversions.</p>

<h2 id="slowness-kills-search-results-pages">Slowness <em>Kills</em> Search Results Pages</h2>

<p>As little time as web sites have to keep users on their pages, search engines have even less time to keep searchers on their results pages. Speed is the primary factor in determining customers’ satisfaction with search results.</p>

<p>Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo garner <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/11/comScore_Releases_October_2013_US_Search_Engine_Rankings">95% of the search market</a>. <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> Google garners two-thirds of the search market. The company’s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Google+Gospel+of+Speed">Gospel of Speed</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> motto is one reason why Google garners the majority of the market.</p>

<p>This gospel has also set a high bar for all search engines. Searchers expect results pages to load very, very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="how-weve-made-our-result-pages-load-faster">How We’ve Made Our Result Pages Load Faster</h2>

<p>So, when we established the service’s open source architecture in 2010, the first thing we tackled was how to deliver our search results in under one second.</p>

<p>At around the same time, <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> was experiencing exponential growth and the company’s engineers were blogging about what they did to make Github fast. To get up to speed quickly (yes, bad pun intended), we read their posts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/blog/530-how-we-made-github-fast">How We Made GitHub Fast</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, October 20, 2009</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/blog/1252-how-we-keep-github-fast">How We Keep GitHub Fast</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, September 5, 2012</li>
</ul>

<p>Leveraging some of Github’s best practices, we succeeded in delivering our results in under 700 milliseconds, on average. This was a significant accomplishment and improvement from the previous vendor-owned and -operated iterations of our service.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, we’ve dug in and improved our response time even more. We now deliver our results in under 380 milliseconds, on average.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/serp_reponse_times.png" alt="App server response times" title="App server response times" /></p>

<p>We already had an architecture optimized for speed. So, how have we sped it up by 320 milliseconds?</p>

<h3 id="we-cache-when-we-can">We Cache When We Can</h3>

<p>When a searcher enters a query, we go out to our various indexes, pull the information relevant to the searcher’s request, and put that information together on the results page.</p>

<p>Most queries (such as jobs, obama, unclaimed money, forms) aren’t unique and are asked by thousands of searchers each day.</p>

<p>We cache these so-called short head queries and store them on our servers. Caching helps us speed up the above process because searchers don’t have to wait for us to pull the information from its original source.</p>

<h3 id="we-use-an-asset-pipeline">We Use an Asset Pipeline</h3>

<p>We have many JavaScript and CSS files on our results pages. These “assets” can be large and slow down the loading of our page. So, we use an <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to concatenate and compress our JavaScript and CSS assets thereby reducing the number of requests that a browser has to make to render our results page.</p>

<p>We also use fingerprinting—a technique that makes a file’s name dependent on its content—within our asset pipeline. When the content changes, the name changes. For content that is static or that changes infrequently, this naming helps us tell whether two versions of a file are identical. When a filename is unique, browsers keep their own copy of the content. When the content is updated, the fingerprint changes so browsers request a new copy of the content. This approach allows us to maximize our content delivery network.</p>

<h3 id="we-use-a-content-delivery-network">We Use a Content Delivery Network</h3>

<p>Our static content (such as scripts and stylesheets) gets served through our <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">content delivery network</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> provider, currently Akamai. Akamai serves our static content from its server that is geographically closest to the searcher. The closer, the faster.</p>

<p>Using a content delivery network also allow us to optimize our service’s speed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directing non-cached traffic between our two datacenters to create a <a href="/releases/2012-10-19.html">multihomed environment</a>. Multihoming allows us to make full use of all of our servers. By contrast, in 2010, our disaster recovery datacenter often sat idle.</li>
  <li>Reducing our need to add bandwidth or servers to handle short-term traffic spurts, such as spurts related to natural disasters.</li>
  <li>Protecting against denial of service attacks by spotting them before they reach our servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>We’ve worked hard over the past three years to speed up the delivery of our results by optimizing each link in the chain.</p>

<p>We use several monitoring tools to measure our system’s performance. The quality of these tools is improving at a rapid pace, which in turn, shows us where and how we can improve our service.</p>

<p>We regularly ask ourselves, “Will <em>this</em> shave some time off and help us deliver our results in <em>under</em> 380 milliseconds?”</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlight-compare-your-click-thru-rate-to-the-average-rate">Highlight: Compare Your Click-thru Rate to the Average Rate</h2>

<p>How do you stack up? You can now compare your click-thru rate (CTR) with the average rate across all sites that use DigitalGov Search. Use your CTR data to measure the performance of specific campaigns and modules.</p>

<p>For example, October’s Monthly Report for <a href="http://kids.usa.gov/">Kids.gov</a> shows the average CTR for Best Bets: Graphics on Kids.gov is 26.8%, while the average CTR across all DigitalGov Search sites is 14.0%. Their <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">graphic best bets</a> are very effective compared to other sites.</p>

<p>See how Kids.gov’s other modules stack up against the average below.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/releases-kidsgov-ctr.png" alt="Average CTR" /></p>

<p>This means that the graphic best bets (such as seen for a <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=kidsgov&amp;query=george+washington">search on <em>George Washington</em> on Kids.gov</a>) are almost twice as likely to be clicked on Kids.gov than other sites.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember your audience. <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2012/08/06/how-kids-search/">Kids use search differently than adults</a> and they’re probably more attracted to graphic images.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/releases-kidsgov-bbg.png" alt="George Washington Best Bets: Graphic" /></p>

<p>Go to the <a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly Reports</a> page in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a> to see how you stack up.</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We made the final cutover to our new Admin Center. As part of the cutover, we updated all of our <a href="/manual/index.html">help files</a> and removed 404 pages from our search results. We also migrated our <a href="/manual/best-bets-graphics.html">Best Bets: Graphics</a> and My Account pages.</li>
  <li>You’re no longer asked to provide a phone number or address when you <a href="https://search.usa.gov/signup">register for a new account</a>.</li>
  <li>Librarians, developers, and others can see a list of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial <a href="http://govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/">government URLs</a> that aren’t .gov or .mil.</li>

  <li>We set up <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> to identify areas of our code that can be improved.</li>
  <li>We phased out color schemes and now offer two options, default and custom.</li>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/todays-snapshot.png" alt="Today's Snapshot" /></p>

<p>On <a href="/manual/site-overview.html">Today’s Snapshot</a>, you can view top queries and clicks, trending queries and URLs, queries with no results, and queries with low click thrus.</p>

<p><a href="/manual/monthly-reports.html">Monthly reports</a> and <a href="/manual/queries.html">query</a> and <a href="/manual/clicks.html">click</a> stats are also available through the new Analytics section.</p>

<p>We’ve also made it easier for you to manage the content that displays on your search results page by placing it all within one section, Manage Content.</p>

<p>Another section, Manage Display, makes it easier for you turn <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">display features</a> on and off and to <a href="/manual/brand.html">brand</a> your results page by selecting your font and color scheme, managing your image assets, and adding header and footer links. Plus, you can now edit the ‘News’ label on the News Govbox.</p>

<p>You can read our updated help by clicking on the Help? link on each page in the Admin Center, or see the full set of help files on our <a href="/manual/index.html">How to Set Up Your Search Box</a> page.</p>

  <li>We moved some servers to a new datacenter and resolved a bandwidth issue between our datacenters.</li>
  <li>We sent Microsoft an updated list of federal, state, and local government domains that aren’t .gov or .mil so that searchers can get results from these websites on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We updated our stemming file to fix a stemming issue with organ* so that searches on organic no longer find results for organizations, organisms, or other irrelevant terms.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlight-add-a-url">Highlight: Add a URL</h2>

<p>Are specific web pages missing from your Bing web results? Tell us about these pages and we’ll append the pages to your web results. We offer two ways for you to tell us about the web pages that you want us to fetch and include in our web index.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a specific URL manually.</li>
  <li>Use an RSS feed to manage your URLs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Go to Manage Content &gt; <a href="/manual/domains.html">Domains</a> &gt; <a href="/manual/domains-advanced.html">Advanced</a>. Select Supplement URLs to add an individual URL or select Supplemental Feed to add multiple URLs via an RSS feed.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/Add_Supplemental_URL.png" alt="Add a Supplemental URL" /></p>

<p>We’ll fetch the URLs you add and we’ll index their metadata (title, description, and URL) <strong><em>plus the full text of the web page or document</em></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For supplemental URLs, searchers now see a snippet from either the metadata (description field) or full document text (body field), depending on which field matches their search term.</li>
  <li>You now see better error messages for supplemental URLs that we couldn’t index.</li>
  <li>You can now access https results from our Search API.</li>
  <li>You now see a clickable URL for system alerts posted in the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
  <li>We rolled out the first pages our new, beta Admin Center—the <a href="/manual/settings.html">Settings</a> and <a href="/manual/users.html">Manage Users</a> pages and their corresponding <a href="/manual/index.html">help files</a>.</li>
  <li>Developers now see unique descriptions for CPSC items in the recalls API.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We set up a new cloud server to host our list of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial <a href="http://govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/vocab/index.php">government URLs that aren’t included in the .gov or .mil top-level domains</a> that are cataloged using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tematres/">TemaTres</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>.</li>
  <li>We moved the cached results for our commercial web indexes into a separate static cache subdirectory so that they (a) can be pruned at their own rate and (b) persist across production pushes.</li>
  <li>We now use a persistent file for your header and footer CSS instead of generating it each time we load your results page.</li>
  <li>We now return a 404 not found status code for static files that we don’t have. We used to return a 406.</li>
  <li>We now index <a href="https://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?organization_id=US-WA:CITY-SEATTLE">Seattle.gov jobs</a> in our <a href="/developer/jobs.html">Jobs API</a>.</li>
  <li>We updated our <a href="/developer/index.html">API documentation</a> to highlight the primary data sources for each API.</li>
  <li>We started collecting your feedback on our new, beta <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</li>
  <li>We reviewed the click data for our related search results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We improved our validation check for manually added supplemental URLs.</li>
  <li>We fixed the message that you see after you upload an invalid RSS feed for the supplemental URLs so that it is more actionable.</li>
  <li>We now escape special characters like apostrophes so that searchers don’t see unescaped values within the snippets of supplemental URLs.</li>
  <li>You can now add <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a> without the http:// or https:// prefix.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve spent the past few weeks doing some spring cleaning to improve our backend infrastructure and to lay the groundwork for a major update to our Admin Center. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We started using the Rails <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a>. As a result of using the pipeline and some of the other chores below, we decreased the page load time by 25 percent.</li>
  <li>We upgraded to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/0-90-1-released/">Elasticsearch 0.90.1</a>.</li>
  <li>We upgraded to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/05/14/ruby-2-0-0-p195-is-released/">Ruby 2.0.0</a>.</li>
  <li>We updated the way we monitor <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/category/passenger/phusion-passenger-4/">Phusion Passenger</a>.</li>
  <li>We removed some unused tables and columns from our MySQL database.</li>
  <li>We removed the legacy recalls code from our codebase now that we’ve released it as a standalone open source <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api">Recalls API Server</a>.</li>
  <li>We no longer require a valid API key to include API queries in your <a href="/tagged/analytics">site analytics</a>.</li>
  <li>We updated our list of synonyms to include fracking and hyrdofracturing as equivalent terms.</li>
  <li>The hyperlinks in the Admin Center system alerts are now clickable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed a regression bug with <a href="https://github.com/haml">Haml</a> and Ruby 2.0.0 that made the background color of the search results the same color as the page background.</li>
  <li>We fixed the CSS for the magnifying glass on the search box so that it appears properly in IE7.</li>
  <li>We now only show unique descriptions for CPSC recalls.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2-highlighted-features">2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="1-search-your-twitter-lists">1. Search Your Twitter Lists</h3>

<p>Does your agency have dozens of Twitter accounts? Do you have a public Twitter list for these accounts? You can now opt to <a href="/manual/twitter.html">index tweets</a> from your lists. You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show tweets from your Twitter account only (for example, index and show tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/USDA">@USDA</a> only)</li>
  <li>Show tweets from your account’s public lists (for example, index and show tweets from the all members of @USDA’s list, <a href="https://twitter.com/USDA/lists/usda-twitter-accounts">USDA Twitter accounts</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>(Thanks, <a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH.gov</a> team, for suggesting this new feature!)</p>

<h3 id="2-search-your-multimedia-galleries">2. Search Your Multimedia Galleries</h3>

<p>Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency’s photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery?</p>

<p>You can now opt to <a href="/manual/rss.html">index MRSS feeds</a> so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.</p>

<p>MRSS is the standard <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">media RSS specification</a> for syndicating multimedia content. So, even if you don’t have an MRSS feed now, it should be easy to generate one as long as your content is in a content management system or other database. MRSS is also the standard specification used by hosted multimedia services such as Flickr, Instagram, Vimeo, and YouTube.</p>

<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">search@support.digitalgov.gov</a> if you have any questions about how to set up an MRSS feed to index your multimedia content.</p>

<p>(Thanks, <a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS.gov</a> team, for suggesting this new feature!)</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>

  <li>For each result, searchers now see the URL directly under the title. The order is now title-URL-description. It had previously been title-description-URL.</li>
  <li>Searchers using screen readers now hear plain language labels for the search box—Enter your search term (English) and Ingrese su búsqueda (Spanish).</li>
  <li>When searchers opt to allow us to use their location, they now see <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">jobs</a> that are geographically closest them.</li>
  <li>Mobile searchers now see your site’s display name as the alt tag for your mobile logo.</li>
  <li>You can now access jobs data in our search API so that, if you use our API, you can display jobs in your search results.</li>
  <li>Searchers on Spanish-language websites now see the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a> when they search on jobs-related terms. For example, a Jobs GovBox appears on GobiernoUSA.gov for a search on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=gobiernousa&amp;query=trabajos"><em>trabajos</em></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We updated how we index and store <a href="/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>, including YouTube feeds, so that we index each feed only one time.</li>
  <li>We now return a Bad Request message for recalls API searches that specify a page greater than 20, which is <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api/commit/0539ce559cae7c4f9360f56dba91932bc48ebb4c">outside of the allowed range</a>.</li>
  <li>When available, we now <a href="https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api/commit/74ff28198b2e09418d9d0826fffdcb99bd7fd22f">pull CPSC’s URLs</a> for their recalls from their 301 or 302 response headers.</li>
  <li>We now filter out federal jobs with more than 20 locations.</li>
  <li>We removed the code for our forms feature on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and federal forms API. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectMyUSA">@ProjectMyUSA</a> to see how the MyUSA team is working to improve the public’s experience with federal forms.</li>
  <li>We removed the code that created a separate mobile version of USA.gov. Visit  <a href="http://www.USA.gov">http://www.USA.gov</a> to see its new, responsive design.</li>
  <li>We updated the cron script for our monthly analytics emails.</li>
  <li>We updated our stemming file.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed the pagination in our search API so that the API now consistently returns 10 results (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc).</li>
  <li>We tweaked the Spanish translations for the <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">jobs GovBox</a>.</li>

  <li>We now provide a better response when an API call specifies the ‘doc’ index but doesn’t include the required, complementary ‘dc’ parameter.</li>

<p>Do you want to set up a search box (or even hundreds of search boxes) over a subset of your content?</p>

<p>You can set up a <a href="/manual/collections.html">Collection</a>. Or, you can now pass in a ‘sitelimit’ parameter to filter the results to specific folders or domains.</p>

<h3 id="option-1-set-up-a-collection">Option 1. Set Up a Collection</h3>

<p>See the sample results page on <a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH.gov</a> that shows results for a search on <a href="http://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&amp;dc=565&amp;query=cancer"><em>cancer</em></a> in NIH.gov’s New Releases.</p>

<p>Note that the searcher sees that results are filtered to News in the left-hand menu.</p>

They’ll still be able to scroll infinitely through the search results while the footer is visible. To hide the footer, they can click on the icon again.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlighted-feature-jobs-govbox">Highlighted Feature: Jobs GovBox</h2>

<p>We’re excited to announce that searchers looking for jobs on your site can now see all of your agency’s current job openings.</p>

<p>Our new <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Job Openings GovBox</a> displays up to three location- and keyword-matched job openings on your results page. For more information on how to turn on this GovBox, see <a href="/manual/display-overview.html">How To Select The Modules That Appear On Your Results Page</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve open sourced all of the code that powers our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">Jobs Server API</a> in Github.</p>

<p>We analyzed data on jobs-related searches to ensure that the new federal <a href="/manual/govbox-jobs.html">Jobs GovBox</a> lists the most relevant job openings.</p>

<p>Searchers can now effectively search for jobs by keyword, agency, state, or work schedule (part-or full-time).</p>

<p>We also focused on not showing the Jobs GovBox when it isn’t relevant (for example, it is no longer shown when searchers look for job safety posters or employment verification forms).</p>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We added our posting channel ID to all USAJobs links.</li>
  <li>We set up a cron job to fetch and process job files from USAJobs.</li>
  <li>We added impression and click tracking for the Jobs GovBox module.</li>
  <li>We resolved performance discrepancy between our <a href="/releases/october-2012.html">two datacenters</a>.</li>
  <li>We no longer use XML sitemaps to add documents to our web index.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can now delete keywords from text best bets.</li>
  <li>Newly added misspellings are now being applied to type-ahead suggestions.</li>
  <li>Searchers can now find jobs in non-standard state locations (for example someone searching for jobs in Washington, DC, will find postings the the location of Washington DC Metro Area, District of Columbia).</li>
  <li>We’ve already pushed two bug fixes for the Jobs GovBox to production. Searchers no longer see yet-to-be-opened or already closed jobs.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2-highlighted-features">2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="1-common-search-metrics-for-the-digital-strategy">1. Common Search Metrics for the Digital Strategy</h3>

<p>Do you ever feel like you’re drowning in data? Do you feel like finding meaningful insights from the data is like searching for a needle in a haystack?</p>

<p>To standardize and streamline how agencies collect and report this data, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a> requires federal executive branch agencies to implement common performance and customer satisfaction metrics. DigitalGov has published <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/07/29/digital-metrics-for-federal-agencies/">guidance on common metrics</a>, including describing what you should measure, what to do with the data, and common tools to help you collect and analyze your metrics.</p>

<p>To support you in collecting and reporting your site <a href="/tagged/analytics">search metrics</a> for the Digital Government Strategy, we’ve added four new reports to the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Top “no results” queries.</strong> The most popular, valid searches that don’t return any results on your site’s search results page (e.g., because you don’t have the content on your site, or the content isn’t findable by the person’s search term). Review your content to see if you need to add new content, or update existing content to include the words your readers search for.</li>
  <li><strong>Top searches with low click through rates.</strong> The most popular search terms that people generally don’t act (click) on. Consider incorporating language from these popular search terms into page titles or descriptions, to encourage searchers to click on your relevant page.</li>
  <li><strong>Top changing search terms (movement up/down).</strong> Shows trending topics, what’s hot or not. Use this report to investigate why people might be losing interest in once-popular content and consider archiving if it’s no longer needed. For newly popular terms, create new content or update existing content to ensure it’s current, accurate, and complete.</li>
  <li><strong>Top clicked URLs for specific queries.</strong> The most common results that searchers found most relevant or appealing, for specific search terms. Review these popular pages and other customer top tasks to make sure they are current, accurate, complete and compelling.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2-recommended-pages-in-type-ahead-suggestions">2. Recommended Pages in Type-ahead Suggestions</h3>

<p>Searchers often know the exact page they’re looking for. We’ve added a feature to help them find that page even more quickly.</p>

<p>As searchers type in their query, relevant <a href="/manual/best-bets-text.html">text Best Bets</a> are shown as Recommended Pages, as shown in the sample below for a search on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?query=jobs&amp;affiliate=u.s.departmentoflabor"><em>fa…</em> on DOL.gov</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/tumblr_mdljlrljT71qid15q.png" alt="Type-ahead suggestions on DOL.gov's search results  page" /></p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Searchers can narrow RSS news results by custom date ranges.</li>
  <li>Searchers now see more images above the fold on image results pages.</li>
  <li>Searchers see integrated image results across both the images on your website and in your Flickr photostream.</li>
  <li>You can now add the <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digtital Analytics Program’s</a> government-wide analytics tag to your search results pages. Email the Digital Analytics Program at <a href="mailto:DAP@gsa.gov">DAP@gsa.gov</a> for more information on setting up the government-wide analytics tag.</li>
  <li>When you <a href="/manual/twitter.html">add your Twitter handle</a> in the Admin Center, we now show the Twitter GovBox by default.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2012-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/releases/october-2012.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlight-upgraded-search-infrastructure">Highlight: Upgraded Search Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Good news! We completed a major upgrade of our search infrastructure. You likely didn’t notice as we completed the upgrade without any downtime for searchers on your site.</p>

<p>Our system is now even more secure, stable, and redundant than it was before. Plus, it is faster, too. Highlights of the upgrade follow.</p>

<p><strong>Multihoming.</strong> We’ve always had a disaster recovery, backup datacenter, but it often sat idle. We wanted to make better use of all of our servers so we’re now leveraging a content delivery network to send traffic to whichever datacenter is geographically closest to the searcher. This allows us to use both datacenters equally and serve our results quickly.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/tumblr_mcd7tbK8RD1qid15q.png" alt="Multihomed" /></p>

<p><strong>New Hardware.</strong> We increased our RAM and CPU resources by five times. We have room to grow and to roll out more features.</p>

<p><strong>Upgraded Software.</strong> We’re now on Red Hat 6 and Cloudera 4.</p>

<p><strong>Speed, Speed, Speed.</strong> We’re always working to improve the speed of our search results. We changed some of our caching rules. We also started to leverage <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> (a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server).</p>

<h2 id="other-chores">Other Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We removed the Hosted Sitemap feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We added alerts to the Admin Center to communicate maintenance windows or other timely content with you.</li>
  <li>Searchers can see keyword-scoped results for collections. If you have a collection below three folder levels deep, <a href="mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov">email us</a> and we’ll help you set up a keyword for your collection.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We now show dates for RSS news items on each customer’s search results page only.</li>
  <li>We fixed a bug which caused highlighted terms on results pages to omit trailing spaces.</li>
  <li>We fixed a bug on how “site:” operators retrieve results.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2-highlighted-features">2 Highlighted Features</h2>

<h3 id="1-infinite-scrolling">1. Infinite scrolling</h3>

<p>Searchers now have the benefit of infinite scrolling on your results pages. What is infinite scrolling? You’ve probably used it on many commercial websites, such as <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=yosemite">Bing Images</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=yosemite">Duck Duck Go</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, <a href="http://pinterest.com/search/boards/?q=yosemite">Pinterest</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/yosemite">Twitter</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i>. It automatically allows searchers to see more results when they get to the bottom of the page, without clicking on the link for the next page of results.</p>

<p>Try it out on your site’s search results page, or on <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=yosemite">USA.gov</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=yosemite"><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/tumblr_mb2awk8xwU1qid15q.png" alt="Infinite scroll on USA.gov's search results page" /></a></p>

<p>Infinite scrolling has many advantages, including:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Speed.</em> The next set of new results loads quicker than a totally new page.</li>
  <li><em>Streamlining the user interface.</em> Studies show most searchers don’t use the next page buttons. Proactively loading results allows searchers to see more results on one page and to compare them.</li>
  <li><em>Simplifying the indexes.</em> When and how we display results from our various web indexes is easier for us, you, and end users.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2-helping-searchers-find-forms">2. Helping searchers find forms.</h3>

<p>Similar to our existing agency and <a href="http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&amp;query=diabetes">health</a> GovBoxes, we created a forms GovBox to help searchers find federal government forms. So far, we’ve included forms from the Department of Defense, General Services Administration, Social Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

<p>We’ve also published the forms data as a Federal Forms API for third-party developers.</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We completely revamped how <a href="/manual/collections.html">collections</a> work to provide you with more flexibility. We encourage you to check out this feature if you’re interested in offering  navigation options in the left-hand sidebar on your results page. You can now create a collection:</li>
  <li>Covering tens of thousands (or even millions) of web pages.</li>
  <li>Covering domains that aren’t part of your primary <a href="/manual/domains.html">domain</a> (i.e., that aren’t shown on the main web results page).</li>
  <li>Without needing to add our Javascript <a href="/manual/code.html">code snippet</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chores">Chores</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We upgraded our robots.txt parser to account for comments and varying cases.</li>
  <li>We eliminated support for six <a href="/blog/legacy-domains.html">legacy domains</a> as part of the .gov web reform project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We fixed broken URLs for Best Bets image files.</li>
  <li>We fixed a bug with our browser user agent so that Internet Explorer users no longer sometimes see a blank results page.</li>
  <li>We fixed a CSS validation bug so you don’t see an error message when editing your header or footer.</li>
  <li>We updated a broken link for Explore Topics on m.USA.gov.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the federal <a href="https://www.usa.gov/WebReform.shtml">.gov web reform</a> project, we’re eliminating six of our legacy domains. Going forward, our only supported domain is search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov, if you’ve requested <a href="/manual/cname.html">DNS masking</a>).</p>

<p>What do you need to do? If your URL starts with any of the following six legacy domains, you must update your HTML form code.</p>

<ol>
  <li>firstgovsearch.gov</li>
  <li>searchusa.gov</li>
  <li>usasearch.gov</li>
  <li>(Spanish) buscador.gov</li>
  <li>(Spanish) buscadorusa.gov</li>
  <li>(Spanish) usabuscador.gov</li>
</ol>

<p>Specifically, you have to update the action of your <a href="/manual/code.html">form code</a> to call search.usa.gov (or search.yoursite.gov).</p>

<p><code>&lt;form method="get" action="https://search.usa.gov/search"&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that, if you don’t update your form code, your search results page will no longer work.</p>

    <id>https://search.gov/releases/july-2012.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of your most frequently asked questions is, “What’s your roadmap?” We decided to use the halfway point of the year to expand our release notes to include notes on our upcoming features.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<h3 id="highlight-searchers-see-recent-tweets-when-they-search-on-your-website">Highlight: searchers see recent tweets when they search on your website</h3>

<p>We’re now displaying Twitter results in the third rail. Searchers like Twitter results because they often contain your latest information. The third rail increases the  visibility of your tweets and it allows searchers to see both Twitter and YouTube results above the fold in the browser.</p>

<p>See the sample results page below that shows social media results on Commerce.gov for a search on <em><a href="http://search.commerce.gov/search?query=innovation&amp;affiliate=commerce.gov">innovation</a></em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/tumblr_m71vk4FInR1qid15q.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you have a Twitter account, tell us the name of your profile and searchers will be able to find relevant, recent tweets when they search on your website.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to the <a href="https://search.usa.gov/sites/">Admin Center</a>. Select your site.</li>
  <li>Click on the Social Media option. Enter the name of your Twitter account and click save.</li>
  <li>Click on the Results Modules option and opt to show your tweets in a GovBox.</li>
</ol>

<p>Wait until you post your next tweet. Then, go to your website and do a search for a word or phrase in the tweet. You’ll see it as a GovBox intermingled with your web results.</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Customers with lots of documents will have them indexed more quickly.</li>
  <li>You may now enter multiple handles if you have more than one social media account for Flickr, Twitter, or YouTube.</li>
  <li>Mobile searchers can see image results.</li>
  <li>You may now see whether we’ve indexed your Twitter or Flickr content.</li>
  <li>We now index Microsoft Office documents (Excel, Word, and PowerPoint).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Address memory bloat.</li>
  <li>Searchers can no longer see multiple sidebar items selected.</li>
  <li>Launch jumpstart index for newly added sites with a single site domain.</li>
  <li>We now label Office documents.</li>
  <li>We fixed an issue with Flickr indexing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-roadmap">Our Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="coming-up-in-july">Coming Up in July</h3>

<p>We “celebrated” during the Fourth of July holiday by focusing on some general housekeeping to ensure stability for the rest of the year. We’ll release new features to index secure (https) content. We’ll also update our discovery tag to power both type-ahead and fetching (eliminating the need for you to have put two sets of javascript on your web pages).</p>

<h3 id="coming-up-next-quarter">Coming Up Next Quarter</h3>

<p>We divide our roadmap into four categories, and we complete one major feature in each category per quarter.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Customer Services.</em> We plan to improve and facilitate our signup process. We’re going to automatically populate more content when you add a site so it is easier for you to take advantage of new features. We also plan to create a dashboard to allow you to see what has changed within your search configuration.</li>
  <li><em>Content Sources.</em> You’ve requested more control to divide search results into content sources, topics, etc. We plan to offer more flexibility to allow you to divide your content as it makes sense for your searchers.</li>
  <li><em>Core Search.</em> One good (or bad) aspect about search is that there is always more work to do in terms of relevancy, speed, scaling, etc. We plan to focus on tuning these aspects, especially for our newer content sources.</li>
  <li><em>Search Analytics.</em> We have a growing amount of data, and we want to expose more of it to you. In parallel with providing you just a dashboard in the Admin Center, we plan to proactively notify you of any potential issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>We hope that this glimpse into our recently released features and our short- and long-term roadmap helps you understand what we’re working on and what’s coming down the road.</p>

<p>Do you have a Flickr photostream? Tell us the name of your photostream. Within minutes, searchers will be able to find relevant images from your Flickr photostream when they search on your website.</p>

<p>We’ve found that those of you who have a Flickr photostream have higher quality image results from your photostream than from your web pages.

  <p>After our migration of Commerce.gov to Drupal, we used the native search tool. However, after looking at the internal site search analytics, it was obvious visitors were not finding what they were looking for. [DigitalGov Search] integrated easily into our system and provided several new features. I appreciate the auto-fill and sort by source features and so do our visitors. Our analytics logs report a much higher percentage of searches resulting in what the visitor was looking for.</p>

In the report, Gartner notes that DigitalGov Search addresses the key aspects of designing a search system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gartner identifies key stages of action in “Your Enterprise Search Project: The Outward Spiral.” [DigitalGov Search] addressed them all:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Staffing</em> the project with experts who had domain knowledge.</li>
    <li><em>Scoping</em> the project using those personnel to satisfy search requirements for federal websites.</li>
    <li><em>Selecting</em> the right technology.</li>
    <li><em>Implementing</em> it effectively with workers who have the right skill sets.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>The [DigitalGov Search] tool is awesome. It makes finding things on our website easier than ever. The results that come back are both quick and relevant. My favorite feature has to be Query Logs. What our users are looking for is now crystal clear, which makes my life way easier. It provides insight into what users want that is sometimes very hard to find. It also allows us to promote the correct content.<br />
 <br />
For instance, for several months our most search terms were employment and jobs, so we created a Jobs page and put it right on our homepage. After that the search for those terms dropped dramatically, which means users no longer had to poke and search for Jobs/Employment information because it was right where it needed to be.<br />
 <br />
I almost couldn’t believe that this amazing service is free. It’s easy to implement and full of useful features, which would normally cost us quite a lot and in this economy it’s these types of services that help us save money.</p>

  <p>We encourage the use of shared services across government agencies and we want to make WhiteHouse.gov an example for others to follow. It would not be possible to match the value of GSA’s free search service by procuring or building a custom solution. Previously, we needed to dedicate significant resources to configuring and tuning our internal solution, whereas with [DigitalGov Search], we can now deploy these resources to enhance the features of and technology supporting the White House website.</p>

<p>In line with the GSA’s cost-saving “build once, use many times” paradigm, DigitalGov Search provides hosted search services for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a> and hundreds of other government websites. This is done in a cost-effective way, especially for the agencies involved, which receive these services at no cost.</p>

<p>From the Award presentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The GSA is to be congratulated for their mission-focused, citizen-centered, open approach to a big data challenge and a resulting solution that improves the experience of a broad swath of users of federal services. On behalf of our judges and the many citizens who use this capability on a daily basis we say thank you, and congratulations on this well deserved recognition.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>InformationWeek</em> yesterday <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/galleries/government/leadership/231600939">recognized 15 government agencies</a> for taking on ambitious IT initiatives in an effort to provide better services at a lower cost.</p>

<p>Former federal CIO Vivek Kundra talked often about the technology gap that separates government workers from private-sector employees. Federal, state, and local government agencies have many initiatives under way in an effort to close that gap.</p>

<p>They’re employing cloud computing, software as a service, the Web, mobile technologies, and more to give government workers the tools they need to be more productive and to deliver public services more efficiently.</p>

<p>GSA’s DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) was one of those honored by <em>InformationWeek</em> for making government services in English and in Spanish more accessible online with a revamped version of DigitalGov Search and its set of advanced search technologies for <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>. Noted was our use of Microsoft’s Bing Index, open source technologies such MySQL, Hadoop, and OpenCalais, and employing agile development to deliver new features quickly.</p>

    <link href="https://search.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html"/>
    <updated>2011-06-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://search.gov/blog/adopting-hadoop.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The United States federal government’s DigitalGov Search program provides hosted search services for government affiliate organizations, shares APIs and web services, and operates the government’s official search engine on <a href="http://www.usa.gov">USA.gov</a>. DigitalGov Search offers free search services to any federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government agency. Several hundred websites make use of this service, ranging from the smallest municipality to larger federal sites like <a href="http://www.weather.gov">http://www.weather.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.usa.gov">http://www.usa.gov</a>. DigitalGov Search leverages the Bing API as the basis for its web results and then augments the user search experience by providing a variety of government-centric information such as related search topics and highlighted editorial content. The entire system is comprised of a suite of open-source tools and resources, including Apache Solr/Lucene, OpenCalais, and Apache Hadoop. Of these, our usage of Hadoop is the most recent. We began using <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/">Cloudera’s Distribution including Apache Hadoop</a> <i class="icon-external-link"><span>(External link)</span></i> (CDH3) for the first time in the Fall, and since then we’ve seen our usage grow every month—not just in scale, but in scope as well. But before highlighting everything DigitalGov Search is doing with Hadoop today, I should explain why we began using it in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="phase-1-search-analytics">Phase 1: Search analytics</h2>

<p>All of the search and API traffic across hundreds of affiliate sites, iPhone apps, and widgets comes through a single search service, and this generates a lot of data. To improve the service, administrators wanted to see aggregated information on what sorts of information searchers were looking for, how well they were finding it, what trends were forming, and so on. Once searches were initiated, they also wanted to know what results were shown and then what results were clicked on. They wanted to see all this information broken down by affiliate over time, and also aggregated across the entire affiliate landscape.</p>

<p>The initial system, like many initial systems, was fairly simple and did just enough to address our most pressing analytics needs. We took the logs from Apache and Ruby on Rails, put them in a big MySQL database on a separate machine, ran nightly and monthly jobs on them, and then exported the summary results to the main database cluster to be served up via a low-latency Rails web interface for analytics. We used a separate physical database machine with lots of memory and disk for the batch processing to keep our production MySQL instances from being impacted by this resource-intensive batch processing.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/tumblr_lle73iJ2Ts1qid15q.png" alt="Initial dataflow of raw logfiles to analytics apps" /></p>

<p>As we watched the main database tables grow and the nightly batch jobs take longer and longer, it became clear that we would soon exhaust the resources available on the single database analytics processing node. We looked at scaling up the hardware vertically and sharding the database horizontally, but both options seemed like we were just kicking the can down the road. Larger database hardware would be both costly and eventually insufficient for our needs, and sharding promised to take all the usual issues associated with a single database system (backups, master/slaves, schema management) and multiply them. We wanted the system to be able to grow cost effectively and without downtime, be naturally resilient to failures, and have backups handled sensibly. It was at this point that we started investigating HDFS, Hadoop, and Apache Hive.</p>

<p>HDFS offered us a distributed, resilient, and scalable filesystem while Hadoop promised to bring the work to where the data resided so we could make efficient use of local disk on multiple nodes. Hive, however, really pushed our decision in favor of a Hadoop-based system. Our data is just unstructured enough to make traditional RDBMS schemas a bit brittle and restrictive, but has enough structure to make a schema-less NoSQL system unnecessarily vague. Hive let us compromise between the two—it’s sort of a “SomeSQL” system.</p>

<p>But best of all, we could layer the entire Cloudera stack on top of a subset of our existing production machines. By making use of each machine’s excess reserve capacity of disk, CPU, and RAM, we were able to get a small proof-of-concept cluster stood up without purchasing any new hardware. The initial results confirmed that our workload lent itself well to distributed processing, as one job went from taking over an hour on a MySQL node to 20 minutes on a three machine Hadoop cluster. Within a week of getting the prototype up and running, we had transitioned all the remaining nightly analytics batch SQL jobs into Hive scripts. The job output fed into a collection of intermediate Hive tables, from which we generated summary data to export to MySQL as low-latency tables for the Rails web interface to use. To prove the scaling point, we spent five minutes adding another datanode/tasktracker to the mix, kicked off the cluster rebalancer, and the whole process ran faster the next day.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/tumblr_lle73rea1K1qid15q.png" alt="Current dataflow of raw logfiles to analytics apps" /></p>

<h2 id="phase-2-feedback-loop">Phase 2: Feedback loop</h2>

<p>The result of all this analysis in Hive shows up not just in various analytics dashboards, but as part of the search experience on many government websites, too. For example, compare the different type-ahead suggestions for ‘<strong>gran</strong>’ on <a href="http://www.nps.gov">http://www.nps.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.usa.gov">http://www.usa.gov</a>. Both sites use the same DigitalGov Search backend system, but the suggestions differ completely. We use Hadoop to help us generate contextually relevant and timely search suggestions for hundreds of government sites like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/tumblr_lle73ymed31qid15q.png" alt="Different type-ahead suggestions on NPS.gov and USA.gov" /></p>

<h2 id="phase-3-internal-monitoringstrong">Phase 3: Internal monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;</h2>

<p>Shortly after moving our event stream analysis from MySQL to Hadoop/Hive, we noticed a change in how we thought about data. Freed from the constant anxiety of wondering how we were going to handle an ever-increasing amount of data, we shifted from trying to store only what we really needed to storing whatever we thought might be useful. We first turned our attention to the performance data emitted by the various sub-systems that make up the search program.</p>

<p>Each search results page is potentially made up of many data modules sintered together from calls to the Bing API, our own Solr indexes, a MySQL cluster, and a Redis cache. A small latency problem with any one of them can propagate through the system to create much larger problems, so we want to have a deep knowledge of how each subsystem behaves throughout the day under various circumstances. We were already monitoring the availability of all these services with Opsview, but we had no insight into their performance over time. Whenever we sensed a problem (“Is one of the Solr indexes getting slow?”), we would liberally apply ssh, tail -f, and grep to try to see what was going on. This seemed like a good use case for Hive, so in the case of Solr, for example, we threw the compressed log files into HDFS, wrote a simple SerDe regular expression to define rows in a Hive table partitioned by date, and built a view on top of that for easy manipulation of extracted columns such as the Solr index name and the hour of day. Hive makes it trivially easy to do some fairly sophisticated aggregate analysis on the response times for each Solr index, such as generating a distribution histogram, or calculating the pth percentile.</p>

<p>Some of these Hive queries are not run very often—perhaps just a few times a month—so we don’t want to spend time building them into our test-driven Rails analytics framework. On the other hand, they are complex enough that we don’t want to rewrite them every time we want to use them. For these cases, we use Beeswax in HUE to save off parameterized queries that can then be shared among engineers or analysts to run on an ad hoc basis.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the space of a few months, we’ve gone from having a brittle and hard-to-scale RDBMS-based analytics platform to a much more agile Hadoop-based system that was designed to scale intrinsically. We continue to see our Hadoop usage grow in scope with each new data source we add, and it’s clear that we’ll be relying on it more and more in the future as the suite of tools and resources around Hadoop grows and matures.</p>

## How to add a new post

1. Clone the `master` branch.
1. Create a new file in the [drafts directory](https://github.com/GSA/search.digitalgov.gov/tree/master/drafts)
   using the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-filename-title.md`
1. Add the YAML block to the top of the file.
   You can use the following [sample file](https://github.com/GSA/search.digitalgov.gov/tree/master/drafts/2014-03-05-sample.md) as a starting point.
1. Add the content of your new post below the YAML block.
   Feel free to use HTML,
   [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or
   [Liquid Extension](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Liquid-Extensions).
1. Add, commit and push your new post back to the repository.
1. After roughly 3 minutes, visit `https://search.digitalgov.gov/drafts/post-filename-title.html` to preview your post.
   If you added a permalink config in your post, visit `https://search.digitalgov.gov/drafts/your-permalink.html`
1. When you're ready to publish your post, move the file from from drafts to the [_posts directory](https://github.com/GSA/search.digitalgov.gov/tree/master/_posts).
